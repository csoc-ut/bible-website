			<h2>Proverbs</h2>


			<h4 id="proverbs-1">1</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, the king of Israel:<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> For knowing wisdom and instruction; / For discerning words of understanding;<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> For receiving instruction in wise conduct, / Righteousness, justice, and equity;<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> For giving prudence to the simple, / Knowledge and discretion to the young man;<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> That the wise man may hear and increase in learning, / And he who has understanding may acquire sound counsel;<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> For understanding proverb and figure, / The words of the wise and their difficult sayings.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; / Fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Hear, my son, the instruction of your father, / And do not reject the teaching of your mother;<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> For they will be a wreath of grace for your head / And ornaments for your neck.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you, / Do not consent.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> If they say, Come with us; let us lie in wait for blood; / Let us ambush the innocent without cause;<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, / And whole, like those who go down into the pit.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> We will find all <i>manner</i> of precious goods; / We will fill our houses with booty;<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Throw in your lot with us; / We will all have one purse —<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> My son, do not walk with them on <i>this</i> way; / Keep your foot from their path.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> For their feet run toward evil, / And they hasten to shed blood.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> For in vain is the net spread / In the eyes of any bird;<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Yet they lie in wait for their own blood; / They ambush their own lives!<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Such are the ways of everyone greedy for gain; / It takes away the life of its owners.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Wisdom cries out in the street; / She utters her voice in the open squares.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> At the head of the tumultuous <i>street</i> she cries; / At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> How long, O simple ones, will you love simpleness, / And will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, / And will fools hate knowledge?<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Turn yourselves at my reproof — / Immediately I will pour out my spirit on you; / I will make my words known to you.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Because I called and you refused; / I stretched out my hand and no one heeded,<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> And you neglected all my counsel / And would have none of my reproof;<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> I also will laugh at your calamity; / I will mock when what you dread comes,<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> When what you dread comes like a storm, / And your calamity comes like a whirlwind, / When distress and anguish come upon you.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; / They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> Because they hated knowledge / And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> <i>And</i> would have none of my counsel / <i>And</i> despised all my reproof;<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> They shall eat of the fruit of their own way / And be filled with their own devices.<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> For the turning away of the simple will kill them, / And the prosperity of the foolish will cause them to perish;<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> But he who listens to me will dwell securely / And will live at ease, without the dread of evil.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> My son, if you receive my words / And treasure up my commandments within you,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Making your ear attentive to wisdom / And inclining your heart to understanding;<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Indeed, if you cry out for discernment / And lift up your voice for understanding;<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> If you seek her like silver / And search for her like hidden treasures,<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Then you will understand the fear of Jehovah / And find the knowledge of God.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> For Jehovah gives wisdom; / From His mouth <i>come</i> knowledge and understanding;<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; / <i>He is</i> a shield to those who walk in integrity,<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Guarding the paths of justice / And keeping the way of His faithful ones.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Then you will understand righteousness and justice / And equity, <i>indeed,</i> every good path.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> For wisdom will enter your heart, / And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Discretion will watch over you; / Understanding will keep you:<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> To deliver you from the way of evil, / From the man who speaks perverse things,<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> <i>From those</i> who forsake the paths of uprightness / To walk in the ways of darkness,<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Who rejoice in doing evil / <i>And</i> delight in the perverseness of evil,<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Whose paths are crooked, / And who are devious in their ways;<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> To deliver you from the strange woman, / From the adulteress who flatters with her words,<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Who forsakes the companion of her youth / And forgets the covenant of her God;<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> For her house sinks down to death, / And her paths <i>lead</i> to the dead;<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> None who go to her <i>ever</i> return, / Nor do they attain to the paths of life;<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> That you may walk in the way of good men / And keep the paths of the righteous;<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> For the upright will dwell in the land, / And the perfect will remain in it;<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> But the wicked will be cut off from the land, / And the treacherous will be uprooted from it.<br>

			<h4 id="proverbs-3">3</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> My son, do not forget my instruction, / But let your heart keep my commandments;<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> For length of days and years of life / And peace will they add to you.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Do not let lovingkindness and truth forsake you: / Bind them around your neck; / Write them upon the tablet of your heart.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Thus you will find favor and <i>a reputation for</i> fine understanding / In the sight of God and man.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, / And do not rely on your own understanding;<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> In all your ways acknowledge Him, / And He will make your paths straight.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Do not be wise in your own eyes; / Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> It will be healing to your body / And refreshment to your bones.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Honor Jehovah with your substance / And with the firstfruits of all your produce;<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Then your barns will be filled with plenty, / And your vats will burst open with new wine.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> My son, do not despise the chastening of Jehovah, / Nor be weary of His discipline;<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> For whom Jehovah loves He disciplines, / Even as a father, the son in whom he delights.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, / And the man who gains understanding.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> For her profit is better than the profit of silver, / And her income is better than gold.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> She is more precious than corals, / And nothing you desire compares with her.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand; / In her left hand are riches and honor.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, / And all her paths are peace.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her, / And happy are those who hold her fast.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; / He established the heavens by understanding;<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> By His knowledge the depths were broken open / And the skies drop down the dew.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> My son, do not let these depart from your sight: / Keep sound wisdom and discretion;<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> And they will be life for your soul / And a graceful ornament for your neck.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Then you will walk on your way securely, / And your foot will not stumble.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid; / But you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Do not be afraid of sudden fear, / Nor of the destruction of the wicked when it comes;<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> For Jehovah will be your confidence, / And He will keep your foot from being caught.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, / When it is in the power of your hand to do <i>so.</i><br>
				 <sup>28</sup> Do not say to your neighbor, Go, and come back; / And tomorrow I will give <i>it</i> — when you have <i>it</i> with you.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> Do not devise harm against your neighbor, / While he lives securely beside you.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> Do not strive with a man without cause, / If he has done you no harm.<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> Do not envy a man of violence, / And do not choose any of his ways;<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> For the perverse man is an abomination to Jehovah, / But His intimate counsel is with the upright.<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked man, / But He blesses the dwelling place of the righteous.<br>
				 <sup>34</sup> To scorners He is scornful, / But to the humble He gives grace.<br>
				 <sup>35</sup> The wise will inherit honor, / But fools increase <i>their own</i> disgrace.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> Hear, <i>my</i> sons, the instruction of a father, / And be attentive, that you may gain understanding;<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> For I give you good teaching; / Do not forsake my instruction.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> For I was a son to my father, / Tender and the only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And he taught me and said to me, / Let your heart hold fast to my words; / Keep my commandments and live;<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Get wisdom; get understanding; / Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; / Love her, and she will guard you.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> The beginning of wisdom <i>is this:</i> / Get wisdom; and in all your getting, get understanding.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; / She will honor you if you embrace her.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> She will give a garland of grace for your head; / A crown of beauty will she bestow on you.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Hear, my son, and receive my words, / And the years of your life will be many.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> I have taught you in the way of wisdom; / I have led you in the paths of uprightness.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> When you walk, your steps will not be hindered; / And when you run, you will not stumble.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Take hold of instruction; do not let go; / Guard her, for she is your life.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Do not enter the path of the wicked, / And do not walk in the way of the evil.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Avoid it; do not pass by it; / Turn away from it and pass on by.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; / And they are robbed of their sleep unless they cause <i>someone</i> to stumble.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness / And drink the wine of violence.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; / They do not know what they stumble over.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> My son, be attentive to my words; / Incline your ear to my sayings.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Do not let them depart from your sight; / Keep them in the midst of your heart.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> For they are life to those who find them, / And healing to all their flesh.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Keep your heart with all vigilance, / For from it are the issues of life.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Put away from you crooked speech, / And put perverse talk far from you.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Let your eyes look directly ahead, / And let your gaze be straight in front of you.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> Make straight the path of your feet, / And all your ways will be established.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Do not turn to the right or to the left; / Turn your foot away from evil.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> My son, be attentive to my wisdom; / Incline your ear to my understanding,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> That you may keep discretion, / And your lips may guard knowledge.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, / And her mouth is smoother than oil;<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, / Sharp as a two-edged sword.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death; / Her steps hold fast to Sheol.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> She does not make straight the path of life: / Her ways wander, <i>and</i> she does not know <i>it.</i><br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And now, <i>my</i> sons, listen to me, / And do not depart from the words of my mouth.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Keep your way far from her, / And do not go near the door of her house;<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Lest you give your honor to others, / And your years to the cruel;<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Lest strangers be filled with your wealth, / And your labors <i>go</i> to the house of a foreigner,<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And you mourn at your end, / When your flesh and your body are consumed,<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And you say, How I have hated instruction, / And my heart has despised reproof!<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers / Nor inclined my ear to my instructors;<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> I was almost into every evil / In the midst of the congregation and assembly.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Drink waters out of your own cistern, / And running water out of your own well.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Should your springs be shed forth, / <i>Like</i> streams of water in the streets?<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Let them be yours alone, / And not for strangers with you.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Let your fountain be blessed, / And rejoice in the wife of your youth,<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> A lovely hind and a graceful doe. / Let her breasts satisfy you at all times. / May you be ravished with her love always.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> For why should you be ravished, my son, with a strange woman / And embrace the bosom of an adulteress?<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> For the ways of a man are before the eyes of Jehovah, / And He ponders all his paths.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> The wicked man is taken by his own iniquities, / And he is held fast by the cords of his own sin.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> He will die for lack of instruction, / And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> My son, if you have become a surety for your neighbor, / If you have given your hands as a pledge for a stranger,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> You are snared by the words of your mouth; / You are caught by the words of your mouth.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, / Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor: / Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Do not give sleep to your eyes, / Nor slumber to your eyelids.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the <i>hunter’s</i> hand / And like a bird from the fowler’s hand.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Go to the ant, you sluggard; / Consider its ways, and be wise,<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Which, having no chief, / Officer, or ruler,<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Prepares its food in summer / <i>And</i> gathers its sustenance in the harvest.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> How long, sluggard, will you lie <i>there?</i> / When will you arise from your sleep?<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, / A little folding of the hands to rest,<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And your poverty will come <i>upon you</i> like a robber, / And your want, like an armed man.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> A worthless man, a wicked man, / Goes around with a perverse mouth,<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Winking with his eyes, signaling with his feet, / Pointing with his fingers;<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> With perverseness in his heart, he is devising evil continually; / He injects discord.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; / In a moment he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> There are six things that Jehovah hates; / Indeed, seven that are an abomination to His soul:<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, / And hands that shed innocent blood,<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> A heart that devises wicked schemes, / Feet that hurry to run to evil,<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> A false witness who utters lies, / And one who injects discord among brothers.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> My son, keep the commandment of your father, / And do not reject the teaching of your mother;<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Bind them continually on your heart; / Tie them around your neck.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> When you walk about, it will guide you, / When you lie down, it will watch over you; / And when you awake, it will talk with you.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, / And the reproofs of instruction are the way of life,<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> To keep you from the evil woman, / From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Do not desire her beauty in your heart, / Nor let her catch you with her eyelids;<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> For the price of a harlot is <i>a loaf of</i> bread, / But the wife of <i>another</i> man hunts for the precious soul.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Can a man take fire in his bosom / And his clothes not be burned?<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> Can a man walk on hot coals / And his feet not be scorched?<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> So <i>it is with</i> him who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; / No one who touches her will be unpunished.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> The thief is not despised if he steals / To satisfy himself when he is hungry;<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> But if he is found out, he shall restore sevenfold; / He must give over all the substance of his house.<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; / He who does it destroys his own soul.<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> He will find wounds and dishonor, / And his reproach will not be wiped away.<br>
				 <sup>34</sup> For jealousy is the rage of a man, / And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.<br>
				 <sup>35</sup> He will not regard any ransom, / Nor will he be content if you give <i>him</i> great gifts.<br>

				 <sup>4</sup> Say to wisdom, You are my sister, / And call understanding <i>your</i> close friend,<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> That they may keep you from the strange woman, / From the adulteress who flatters with her words.<br>

				 <sup>8</sup> Passing along the street near her corner; / And he takes the way to her house,<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> In the twilight, in the evening of the day, / In the deep of night and darkness.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And there <i>comes</i> a woman to meet him, / Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> She is rowdy and defiant; / Her feet do not stay at home —<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Now in the street, now in the squares, / And at every corner she lies in wait.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And she grabs him and kisses him; / And with an impudent face she says to him,<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> I had to make offerings; / Today I have paid my vows.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Therefore I have come out to meet you, / To earnestly seek your presence; and I have found you.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> I have decked my couch with coverings, / Colored spreads of the linen of Egypt;<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, / Aloes, and cinnamon.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning; / Let us delight ourselves with love.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> For my husband is not at home; / He has gone on a long journey.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> He has taken the money bag with him; / He will come home at the full moon.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> With her great persuasiveness she beguiles him; / With her smooth talk she compels him.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> He goes after her immediately, / As an ox goes to the slaughter, / Or as <i>someone in</i> fetters, to the correction of the fool,<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Until an arrow pierces through his liver. / As a bird hastens to the snare, / So he does not know that this <i>will cost him</i> his life.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> And now, <i>my</i> sons, listen to me, / And pay attention to the words of my mouth.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; / Do not stray into her paths.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> For many are those whom she has brought down wounded, / And numerous are all who have been slain by her.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to Sheol, / Going down to the chambers of death.<br>

				 <sup>22</sup> Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of His way, / Before His works of old.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> I was set up from eternity, / From the beginning, before the earth was.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> When there were no depths, I was brought forth, / When there were no fountains abounding with water.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled, / Before the hills, I was brought forth;<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> When He had not yet made the earth and the fields, / Nor the first dust of the world.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> When He established the heavens, I was there; / When He inscribed a circle upon the surface of the deep,<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> When He made firm the skies above, / When the fountains of the deep became strong,<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> When He set for the sea its boundary, / That the waters should not transgress His commandment, / When He marked out the foundations of the earth;<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> Then I was by Him, <i>as a</i> master workman; / And I was daily <i>His</i> delight, / Rejoicing always before Him,<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> Rejoicing in His habitable earth; / And my delight was in the sons of men.<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> Now therefore, <i>my</i> sons, listen to me; / For blessed are they who keep my ways.<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise; / And do not neglect it.<br>
				 <sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man who listens to me, / Watching daily at my doors, / Waiting at my doorposts.<br>
				 <sup>35</sup> For whoever finds me finds life, / And will obtain favor from Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>36</sup> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul; / All who hate me love death.<br>

				 <sup>23</sup> The north wind brings forth rain; / And a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance.<br>

				 <sup>18</sup> She samples her merchandise <i>to be sure</i> it is good; / Her lamp does not go out by night.<br>
