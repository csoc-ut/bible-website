			<h2>Nehemiah</h2>


			<h4 id="nehemiah-1">1</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capital,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and some men from Judah; and I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, who were left from the captivity, and about Jerusalem.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And they said to me, The remnant who are left from the captivity there in the province are in an exceedingly bad state and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been burned with fire.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And when I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and I mourned for some days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> And said, I beseech You, O Jehovah the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments:<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant, which I pray before You now day and night, concerning the children of Israel, Your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel that we have sinned against You. Indeed, I and the house of my father have sinned;<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> We have been most corrupt toward You and have not kept the commandments and the statutes and the ordinances that You commanded Moses Your servant.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Remember now the word that You commanded Moses Your servant, saying, If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples;<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> But if you return to Me and keep My commandments and perform them, though your outcasts are under the ends of heaven, from there I will gather them and bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> I beseech You, O Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to the prayer of Your servants, who take delight in fearing Your name; and cause Your servant to prosper today, and grant him <i>to find</i> compassion before this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.<br>

			<h4 id="nehemiah-2">2</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, while wine <i>was being set</i> before him, I took up the wine and gave <i>it</i> to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And the king said to me, Why is your face sad, since you are not ill? This is nothing other than sadness of heart. Then I was greatly frightened.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And I said to the king, May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ graves, lies in waste and its gates are consumed with fire?<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And the king said to me, What do you request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> And I said to the king, If it please the king and if your servant has found favor before you, that you would send me to Judah to the city of my fathers’ graves that I may rebuild it.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And the king said to me (and the queen was sitting beside him), How long will your going be, and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a date.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Then I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given to me for the governors beyond the River, so that they will let me pass through until I come to Judah;<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the Park, which belongs to the king, so that he would give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace that belongs to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I will be entering. And the king gave <i>these</i> to me according to the good hand of my God, which was upon me.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> So I went to the governors beyond the River and gave them the king’s letters. And the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard of <i>this,</i> it displeased them greatly that a man had come seeking the good of the children of Israel.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Thus I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And I arose at night, I and some few men with me. And I told no man what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. And there was no animal with me except the animal I rode on.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And I went out at night by the Valley Gate, toward the Jackals’ Spring and the Dung Gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down and whose gates had been consumed with fire.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for the animal under me to pass through.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> And I went up at night by the brook and inspected the wall, and turned back and went in by the Valley Gate and <i>so</i> returned.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And the rulers did not know where I had gone or what I had been doing; and I had not as yet told <i>it</i> to the Jews and the priests and the nobles and the rulers and the rest who were to do the work.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Then I said to them, You see the bad state we are in, that Jerusalem lies in waste and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And I told them about the hand of my God, which was good upon me, and also about the king’s words, which he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build; and they strengthened their hands for the good <i>work.</i><br>
				 <sup>19</sup> But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arabian heard of <i>it,</i> they mocked us and despised us; and they said, What is this thing that you will do? Will you rebel against the king?<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> And I answered them and said to them, The God of heaven Himself will make us prosper; therefore we His servants will rise up and build. But you have no portion nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem.<br>

			<h4 id="nehemiah-4">4</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> And when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he became angry and was greatly enraged; and he mocked the Jews.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And he spoke to his brothers and the army of Samaria and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore <i>it</i> for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the dust heaps, though they are burned?<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, Even their stone wall that they are building, if a fox were to go up <i>on it,</i> he would breach <i>it.</i><br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Hear, O our God, for we are despised; and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them as spoil in the land of captivity;<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> And do not cover their iniquity and do not let their sin be blotted out before You, for they made provocations before the builders.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its <i>height,</i> for the people had a heart to work.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem was advancing, that the breaches were beginning to be closed up, they became very angry;<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And all of them conspired together to come <i>and</i> fight against Jerusalem and cause confusion in it.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And Judah said, / The strength of the burden bearers fails, / And the debris is great; / And we are not able / To build the wall.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And our adversaries said, They will not know, nor <i>even</i> see, until we come into their midst and slay them and cause the work to stop.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And when the Jews who dwelt near them came, they said to us ten times, <i>They will come up</i> against us from all the places that you turn to.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> So I set <i>men</i> in the lowest places behind the wall, on the exposed areas, and I set the people by families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And when I saw <i>the situation,</i> I rose up and said to the nobles and the rulers and the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them; remember the great and awesome Lord, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> And when our enemies heard that their counsel was known to us and <i>that</i> God frustrated <i>it,</i> we all returned to the wall, each man to his work.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And from that day half of my servants labored in the work, and half of them held the spears and the shields and the bows and the armor; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Those who built the wall and those who carried burdens took the loads with one hand doing the work and with the other holding a weapon.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And as for the builders, each <i>had</i> his sword strapped to his side, and <i>so</i> they built; and he who sounded the trumpet was beside me.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, each far from the other.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> In whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather yourselves to us there. Our God will fight for us.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> So we labored in the work; and half of them held spears from the start of dawn until the stars came out.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> I also said to the people at that time, Let every man and his servant spend the nights inside Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and work by day.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each <i>had</i> his weapon at his right hand.<br>

			<h4 id="nehemiah-5">5</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> And there was a great cry of the people and their wives against their brothers the Jews,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> For there were some who said, With our sons and our daughters we are many; therefore we must get grain that we may eat and live.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And there were some who said, We have pledged our fields and our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain in this famine.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And there were some who said, We have borrowed money against our fields and our vineyards for the king’s tribute.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Yet now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children; and now we are bringing our sons and daughters into bondage as slaves. And some of our daughters have <i>already</i> been brought into bondage; and it is not in our power <i>to deliver them,</i> for our fields and vineyards belong to others.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And when I had considered <i>this matter</i> in my heart, I rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said to them, You men are charging interest, each man against his brother! And I set a great assembly against them.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And I said to them, We have bought back our brothers the Jews who have been sold to the nations according to the best of our ability. So would you even sell your brothers that they would have to be sold <i>back</i> to us? And they held their peace and could find not a word <i>to answer.</i><br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Then I said, The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And even I, my brothers, and my servants lend them money and grain. Let us now abandon such taking of interest.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Restore now to them, as of today, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, as well as the hundredth part of the money and of the grain, new wine, and fresh oil that you charge them as interest.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And they said, We will restore <i>it,</i> and we will require nothing from them; so will we do, even as you say. Then I called for the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> I also shook out the lap <i>of</i> my <i>garment</i> and said, May God shake out in the same way every man from his house and from his possessions who does not perform this promise; even so may he be shaken out and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen; and they praised Jehovah. And the people acted according to this promise.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Moreover from the time that <i>the king</i> appointed me to be governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brothers did not eat the food <i>appointed</i> for the governor.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> But the former governors, who were before me, laid heavy burdens on the people and took from them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants tyrannized the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And I also applied myself to the work on this wall. And we did not acquire fields, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> And there were at my table one hundred fifty men, Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations that surrounded us.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And what was prepared for one day was one ox <i>and</i> six choice sheep; also fowl was prepared for me, as well as all kinds of wine in abundance every ten days. Yet for this I did not demand the food <i>appointed</i> for the governor, for the service was heavy upon this people.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Remember me, O my God, for good, <i>according to</i> all that I have done for this people.<br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="desc">
			<h4 id="nehemiah-6">6</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> And when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arabian and the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that no breach remained in it (though as yet I had not set up the doors in the gates),<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Sanballat and Geshem sent <i>word</i> to me, saying, Come; let us meet together among the villages in the plain of Ono. But they intended to do me harm.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it to come down to you?<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And they sent <i>word</i> to me four times in this way, and I answered them in this way.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in this way the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> In which was written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says <i>it,</i> that you and the Jews intend to rebel; therefore you are building the wall. And, according to these words, you are to be their king.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And you have also set up prophets to declare in Jerusalem concerning you, saying, There is a king in Judah! And now a report will be made to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Then I sent <i>word</i> to him, saying, None of these things that you are saying have happened; rather you have invented them in your own heart.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> For all of them tried to frighten us, thinking, Their hands will be weakened from working, and it will not be done. But now strengthen my hands!<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who had shut himself up. And he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple; and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they are coming to slay you; indeed at night they are coming to slay you.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> But I said, Should a man like me flee? And who, <i>being</i> like me, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him but that he spoke this prophecy against me and that Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> He had been hired for this reason, that I would be frightened and that I would act in such a way as to sin; then they would have <i>cause</i> for an evil report in order to reproach me.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets, who tried to frighten me.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of <i>the month</i> of Elul, in fifty-two days.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And when all our enemies heard of <i>it,</i> all the nations that surrounded us were afraid and fell very low in their own eyes, for they knew that this work was done <i>with the help</i> of our God.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <i>the letters</i> of Tobiah came to them;<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> For many in Judah were sworn to his cause because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as <i>his</i> wife.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> They also spoke of his good deeds before me and reported my words to him. <i>And</i> Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.<br>
			</p>

		<div class="desc">
			<h4 id="nehemiah-7">7</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> And when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and Levites had been appointed,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> I gave my brother Hanani, as well as Hananiah the commander of the citadel, charge over Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than most.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And I said to them, Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while some are standing <i>guard,</i> let them shut the doors, and you bar <i>them;</i> and appoint watches from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his own watch and each opposite his own house.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few in it and no houses had been built.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles and the rulers and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who had first come up, and I found <i>this</i> written in it:<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> These are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each man to his city;<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> And all the people gathered as one man in the open area that was before the Water Gate. And they told Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And he read in it before the open area that was before the Water Gate from <i>first</i> light until midday in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were <i>attentive</i> to the book of the law.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And Ezra the scribe stood upon a wooden platform that had been made for that purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah and Shema and Anaiah and Uriah and Hilkiah and Maaseiah at his right hand; and at his left hand, Pedaiah and Mishael and Malchijah and Hashum and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, <i>and</i> Meshullam.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people); and when he opened it, all the people stood up.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And Ezra blessed Jehovah the great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen, lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshipped Jehovah with <i>their</i> faces to the ground.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Also Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites helped the people understand the law; and the people <i>stood</i> in their place.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And they read in the book, in the law of God, interpreting and giving the sense, so that they understood the reading.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest <i>and</i> scribe, and the Levites who helped the people understand said to all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; do not mourn or weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Then he said to them, Go your way; eat the fat, and drink the sweet <i>wine,</i> and send portions to him for whom nothing has been prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. And do not be grieved, for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Be quiet, for the day is holy; and do not be grieved.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And on the second day the heads of fathers’ <i>houses</i> of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe, that is, in order to gain insight into the words of the law.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And they found it written in the law that Jehovah had commanded through Moses that the children of Israel dwell in booths during the feast in the seventh month,<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> And that they publish and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, Go out to the mountain and bring olive branches and wild olive branches and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of <i>other</i> leafy trees to make booths, as it is written.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> So the people went out and brought <i>them,</i> and all made booths for themselves on their roofs and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God and in the open area <i>before</i> the Water Gate and in the open area <i>before</i> the Gate of Ephraim.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> And all the assembly of those who returned from the captivity made booths and dwelt in the booths, for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so; and there was very great rejoicing.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they held the feast seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.<br>

			<h4 id="nehemiah-9">9</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting and in sackcloth, with earth on their heads.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And the descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God for a fourth part of the day, and for <i>another</i> fourth part they confessed and worshipped Jehovah their God.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Then Jeshua and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, <i>and</i> Chenani stood up on the Levites’ platform and cried out with a loud voice to Jehovah their God.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, <i>and</i> Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from eternity to eternity:And may Your glorious name be blessed, / Which is exalted above all blessing and praise.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> You are Jehovah, / You alone; / You have made heaven, / The heaven of heavens with all its host, / The earth and all that is on it, / The seas and all that is in them; / And You give life to all of them; / And the host of heaven worships You.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> You are Jehovah God, / Who chose Abram / And brought him forth from Ur of the Chaldees / And gave him the name Abraham.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And You found his heart faithful before You / And made a covenant with him, / To give <i>him</i> the land of the Canaanites, / The Hittites, the Amorites, / And the Perizzites and the Jebusites and the Girgashites, / To give <i>it</i> to his seed. / And You have fulfilled Your promises, / For You are righteous.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> And You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt / And heard their cry by the Red Sea,<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And You performed signs and wonders on Pharaoh, / And on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; / For You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them; / And You made Yourself a name, as <i>it is to</i> this day.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And You divided the sea before them, / So that they might pass through the midst of the sea on the dry land; / But their pursuers You threw into the depths, / Like a stone into mighty waters.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Then in a pillar of cloud You led them by day, / And in a pillar of fire by night, / To light the way for them, / On which they should go.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And You came down upon Mount Sinai / And spoke with them from heaven. / And You gave them just ordinances and true laws, / Good statutes and commandments.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And You made known to them / Your holy Sabbath / And prescribed commandments and statutes and a law for them / Through Moses Your servant.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> And You gave them bread from heaven / For their hunger, / And You made water come forth from a rock for them / For their thirst. / And You told them to enter / In order to possess the land, / Which You swore / To give them.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> But they and our fathers acted arrogantly / And stiffened their neck and would not listen to Your commandments.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> And they refused to listen / And would not remember Your wondrous acts, / Which You had done among them. / And they stiffened their neck and appointed a leader / To return to their slavery in Egypt. / But You are a God of forgiveness, / Gracious and compassionate, / Long-suffering and abounding in lovingkindness; / So You did not forsake them.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Indeed when they made for themselves / A molten calf, / And said, This is your God, / Who brought you up out of Egypt, / And showed great contempt;<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> You, in Your great compassion, / Did not forsake them in the wilderness; / The pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day, / To guide them on their way; / Nor the pillar of fire by night, / To light the way for them, on which they should go.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> And You gave Your good Spirit / To instruct them, / And did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, / And gave them water for their thirst.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Indeed for forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; / They did not lack; / Their clothes did not wear out, / And their feet did not swell.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> And You gave them kingdoms and peoples, / And divided <i>these</i> to them as boundaries. / So they took possession of the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, / And the land of Og the king of Bashan.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> And their children You multiplied / Like the stars of heaven, / And You brought them into the land / That You told their fathers / To enter <i>and</i> possess.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> And the children entered / And possessed the land; / And You subdued before them / The inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites; / And You gave them into their hand, / With their kings and the peoples of the land, / That they might do with them as they pleased.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> And they took their fortified cities / And a fertile land, / And took possession of <i>their</i> houses, / Full of every good thing, / Hewn cisterns, vineyards, and olive groves, / And fruit trees in abundance; / And they ate and were satisfied and grew fat, / And they delighted in Your great goodness.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> But they were disobedient and rebelled against You / And cast Your law behind their back. / And they slew Your prophets, / Who had testified against them / In order to turn them back to You; / And they showed great contempt.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors, / And they oppressed them; / But when they cried out to You in the time of their oppression, / You heard from heaven, / And according to Your great compassions You gave them deliverers, / Who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> Then after they had rest, / They again did evil before You; / And You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, / And they had dominion over them. / But when they cried out to You again, / You heard from heaven / And delivered them many times / According to Your compassions.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> And You testified against them in order to turn them back to Your law, / But they acted arrogantly and would not listen to Your commandments; / And they sinned against Your ordinances / (By which, if a man does <i>them,</i> he will live), / And they turned a stubborn shoulder / And stiffened their neck and would not listen.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> Yet You bore with them / For many years / And testified to them by Your Spirit / Through Your prophets, / But they would not give heed; / So You delivered them / Into the hand of the peoples of the lands.<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> Nevertheless in Your abundant compassions / You did not make an end of them; / And You did not forsake them, / For You are a gracious and compassionate God.<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> And now, our God, / The great, the mighty, and the awesome God, / Who keeps covenant and lovingkindness, / Do not let all the hardship seem small in Your sight / Which has come upon us, on our kings, on our rulers, / And on our priests and on our prophets / And on our fathers and on all Your people, / Since the days of the kings of Assyria / Until this day.<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> But You are righteous / In all that has come upon us, / For You have acted faithfully / While we have acted wickedly;<br>
				 <sup>34</sup> And our kings, our rulers, our priests, and our fathers / Have not performed Your law / Nor heeded Your commandments and Your testimonies, / By which You testified against them.<br>
				 <sup>35</sup> But they, in their kingdom and in Your great goodness, / Which You gave them, / And in the broad and fat land / That You put before them, / Did not serve You, nor did they turn / From their evil works.<br>
				 <sup>36</sup> Here we are, slaves today; / And as for the land that You gave to our fathers / To eat of its fruit and its goodness, / Here we are, slaves upon it.<br>
				 <sup>37</sup> And its abundant produce is for the kings / Whom You have put over us because of our sins; / And they rule over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure, / And we are in great distress.<br>
				 <sup>38</sup> And because of all this we are making a firm covenant and setting <i>it</i> in writing, and upon the sealed document are <i>the names of</i> our rulers, our Levites, <i>and</i> our priests.<br>

				 <sup>25</sup> Mattaniah and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem in order to hold the dedication with rejoicing and thanksgiving and singing with cymbals, harps, and lyres.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> So the sons of the singers gathered together from the plain around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> And from Beth-gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built outlying villages for themselves around Jerusalem.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession. <i>One went</i> to the right upon the wall toward the Dung Gate;<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the leaders of Judah,<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,<br>
				 <sup>34</sup> Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,<br>
				 <sup>35</sup> And some of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;<br>
				 <sup>36</sup> And his brothers, Shemaiah and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.<br>
				 <sup>37</sup> And at the Fountain Gate, and straight in front of them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east.<br>
				 <sup>38</sup> And the second company that gave thanks went to meet <i>them,</i> and I after them, with half of the people, upon the wall, above the Tower of the Furnaces, to the Broad Wall,<br>
				 <sup>39</sup> And above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, and by the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.<br>
				 <sup>40</sup> So the two companies that gave thanks stood in the house of God, as well as I and half of the rulers with me;<br>
				 <sup>41</sup> And the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;<br>
				 <sup>42</sup> And Maaseiah and Shemaiah and Eleazar and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah <i>as</i> the overseer.<br>
				 <sup>43</sup> And they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had caused them to rejoice greatly; and the women and children also rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.<br>
				 <sup>44</sup> And on that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, for the heave offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the cities’ fields, the portions assigned by the law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served.<br>
				 <sup>45</sup> And they kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David <i>and</i> Solomon his son.<br>
				 <sup>46</sup> For in the days of David and Asaph, long ago, there were leaders of the singers, and <i>there were</i> songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.<br>
				 <sup>47</sup> And in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required; and they consecrated <i>portions</i> for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated <i>portions</i> for the sons of Aaron.<br>

			<h4 id="nehemiah-13">13</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should enter the assembly of God forever,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> For they did not meet the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them; yet our God turned the curse into a blessing.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And when they heard the law, they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who had been appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, because he was related to Tobiah,<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Had prepared for him a large chamber where previously they had put the meal offering, the frankincense, and the vessels, as well as the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil, <i>as</i> commanded for the Levites and the singers and the gatekeepers, and the heave offerings for the priests.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> But during all this <i>time</i> I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king of Babylon I went to the king; then after some time I asked leave from the king.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And I came to Jerusalem and perceived the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And it grieved me much; therefore I cast all the household utensils of Tobiah out of the chamber.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Then I gave commands, and they purified the chambers; and I returned the vessels of the house of God, the meal offering, and the frankincense there.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given <i>to them</i> and thus the Levites and the singers, who performed the service, had gone back, each to his own fields.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> So I contended with the rulers and said, Why has the house of God been forsaken? Then I gathered them together and set them in their stations.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the fresh oil to the storehouses.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And I appointed treasurers over the storehouses, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and it was their charge to distribute to their brothers.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not blot out my loyal deeds, which I have done for the house of my God and for its services.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> In those days I saw some in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath and bringing in heaps of grain and loading <i>them</i> on their donkeys, as well as wine, grapes and figs, and every kind of load, and they were bringing <i>them</i> into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I protested on the day that they sold food.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And Tyrians who dwelt there were also bringing in fish and every kind of merchandise, and selling <i>it</i> on the Sabbath to the children of Judah and in Jerusalem.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said to them, What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Did not your fathers act this way, and did not our God bring all this trouble upon us and upon this city? But you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and commanded that they not be opened until after the Sabbath; and I set some of my servants at the gates <i>so that</i> no load could enter on the Sabbath day.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> But I testified against them and said to them, Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and that they should come and keep the gates, in order to sanctify the Sabbath day. For this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab;<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> And as for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod; and none of them could speak the language of Judah, but <i>they spoke</i> the language of the respective peoples.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> And I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair; and I made them swear by God, <i>saying,</i> You shall not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> Did not Solomon the king of Israel sin in these matters? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; <i>yet</i> the foreign wives caused even him to sin.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God in marrying foreign women?<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I chased him away from me.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> Remember them, O my God; for they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign. And I appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, each in his work,<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> And for the wood offering, at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.<br>
