			<h4 id="genesis-1">Genesis 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And God made the expanse and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, <i>and</i> fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them upon the earth; and it was so.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit with their seed in them according to their kind; and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And God said, Let there be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And let them be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth; and it was so.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And God set them in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness, and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living animals, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And God said, Let the earth bring forth living animals according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind; and it was so.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And God made the animals of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb that produces seed that is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which has fruit that produces seed; they shall be for you as food.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And to every animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven and to everything that creeps upon the earth, in which is a living soul, <i>I have given</i> every green herb for food; and it was so.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-2">Genesis 2</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Thus the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. When Jehovah God made earth and heaven,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up — for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there He put the man whom He had formed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And a river went forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four branches.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Cush.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one that goes east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Now Jehovah God had formed from the ground every animal of the field and every bird of heaven. And He brought <i>them</i> to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called any living animal, that was its name.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of heaven and to every animal of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper as his counterpart.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Jehovah God built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman and brought her to the man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the man said, / This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh; / This one shall be called Woman / Because out of Man this one was taken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And both the man and his wife were naked and were not ashamed before each other.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-3">Genesis 3</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now the serpent was more crafty than any <i>other</i> animal of the field that Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and <i>that</i> the tree was to be desired to make <i>oneself</i> wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave <i>some</i> to her husband with her, and he ate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And they heard the sound of Jehovah God walking about in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Jehovah God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he said, I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I am naked; so I hid myself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And He said, Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the man said, The woman whom You gave <i>to be</i> with me, she gave me <i>fruit</i> from the tree, and I ate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Jehovah God said to the serpent, / Because you have done this, / You are cursed more than all the cattle / And more than all the animals of the field: / Upon your stomach you will go, / And dust you will eat / All the days of your life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> To the woman He said, / I will greatly multiply / Your pain in your childbearing; / In pain you will bring forth children. / And your desire will be to your husband, / And he will rule over you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And to Adam He said, Because you listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree concerning which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it;Cursed is the ground because of you; / In toil will you eat of it / All the days of your life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And thorns and thistles will it bring forth for you, / And you will eat the herb of the field;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> By the sweat of your face / You will eat bread / Until you return to the ground, / Because from it you were taken; / For dust you are, / And to dust you shall return.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the man called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jehovah God made coats of skin for Adam and for his wife and clothed them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he was taken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> So He drove the man out, and at the east of the garden of Eden He placed the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain and said, I have acquired a man, Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And again she gave birth, to his brother Abel. And Abel was a tender of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And in the course of time Cain brought an offering to Jehovah from the fruit of the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Abel also brought <i>an</i> <i>offering,</i> from the firstlings of his flock, that is, from their fat portions. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and for his offering.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. And Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Cain, Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> If you do well, will not <i>your countenance</i> be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and his desire is for you, but you must rule over him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Now You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and from Your face I will be hidden; and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah put a mark on Cain, so that anyone who found him would not strike him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Cain went forth from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Lamech took two wives for himself: The name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and <i>raise</i> cattle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Lamech said to his wives, / Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; / O wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech; / For I have slain a man for wounding me, / Even a young man for striking me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> If Cain is avenged sevenfold, / Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Adam knew his wife again. And she gave birth to a son and called his name Seth, for, <i>she said,</i> God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain slew him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time <i>men</i> began to call upon the name of Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> On that very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> They and every animal according to its kind and all the cattle according to their kind and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth according to its kind and every bird according to its kind — every bird, every winged creature.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two of all flesh in which was the breath of life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And those who went in, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and Jehovah shut <i>the door</i> behind him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the flood was on the earth forty days; and the waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went about on the surface of the waters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And when the waters had prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, all the high mountains that were under the entire heaven were covered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The waters prevailed fifteen cubits higher, once the mountains were covered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And all flesh that moved upon the earth expired: birds and cattle and animals and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth and all mankind.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Everything in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Thus He blotted out every living being that was upon the surface of the ground, from man to beast to creeping things to the birds of heaven; and they were blotted out from the earth. And only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred fifty days.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And God remembered Noah and all the animals and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> The springs of the deep and the windows of heaven were also stopped, and the rain from the heavens was restrained.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the waters receded steadily from upon the earth. So at the end of one hundred fifty days the waters began to diminish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the waters diminished steadily until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And at the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he sent out the raven; and it went out, going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And he sent out the dove from him to see if the waters had abated from the surface of the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. And he put out his hand and took her and brought her to himself into the ark.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the dove came to him toward evening time, and there in her beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had abated from the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, and she did not return to him again.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And in the six hundred first year, in the first <i>month,</i> the first day of the month, the water was dried up from the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that now the surface of the ground was dry.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And God spoke to Noah, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Go forth from the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh — birds and cattle and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth — that they may swarm on the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> So Noah went forth, as well as his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves upon the earth, went forth from the ark according to their families.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Noah built an altar to Jehovah and took of every clean beast and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jehovah smelled the satisfying fragrance; and Jehovah said in His heart, I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; nor will I ever again smite everything living as I have done.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Throughout all the days <i>that</i> earth <i>remains,</i> / Seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, / And summer and winter, and day and night / Shall not cease.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-9">Genesis 9</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the fear of you and the terror of you shall be upon every animal of the earth and upon every bird of heaven, on everything that creeps on the ground and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; just as <i>I gave you</i> the green herb, <i>so</i> I have given you everything.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But flesh with its life, <i>that is,</i> its blood, you shall not eat.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And indeed your lifeblood I will require; from every animal I will require it. And from <i>every</i> man, from every man’s brother, I will require the life of man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Whoever sheds man’s blood, / By man shall his blood be shed, / For in the image of God / He made man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And you, be fruitful and multiply; / Abound on the earth and multiply in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And I Myself now establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And with every living animal that is with you: the birds, the cattle, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that came out of the ark, every animal of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And I establish My covenant with you, that never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living animal that is with you, for perpetual generations:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I set My bow in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And when I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow is seen in the clouds,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living animal of all flesh, and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the bow will be in the clouds, and I will look upon it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living animal of all flesh that is upon the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Now the sons of Noah who came forth from the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was spread over.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Noah began to be a farmer, and he planted a vineyard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he drank of the wine and became drunk. And he uncovered himself inside his tent.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid <i>it</i> upon both their shoulders, and they walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were <i>turned</i> backward, so that they did not see their father’s nakedness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Noah awoke from his wine and learned what his younger son had done to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he said, / Cursed be Canaan: / A servant of servants / Shall he be to his brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And he said, / Blessed be Jehovah, / The God of Shem; / And let Canaan be his servant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> May God enlarge Japheth, / And let him dwell in the tents of Shem, / And let Canaan be his servant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Noah lived after the flood three hundred fifty years.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Sarai was barren; she had no child.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he treated Abram well on account of her, and there were <i>given</i> to him sheep and oxen and donkeys and male servants and female servants and female donkeys and camels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Jehovah struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he continued on his journey from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> To the place of the altar, which he had made there formerly; and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Abram said, Since You have given me no seed, therefore, a servant in my house is my heir.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And said, My Lord, if I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass on from Your servant.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And let me fetch a morsel of bread that you may sustain yourselves. After that you may pass on, since you have come to your servant. So they said, Do as you have said.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of Jehovah by doing righteousness and justice, that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken concerning him.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Far be it from You to do such a thing, to put to death the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked. Far be it from You! Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justly?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Abraham answered and said, Now behold, I have taken <i>it</i> upon myself to speak to the Lord, though I am but dust and ashes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, will You destroy the whole city because of five? And He said, I will not destroy <i>it</i> if I find forty-five there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And he spoke to Him yet again and said, Suppose forty are found there? And He said, I will not do <i>it,</i> because of the forty.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And he said, Oh may the Lord not be angry if I speak. Suppose thirty are found there? And He said, I will not do <i>it</i> if I find thirty there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And he said, Now behold, I have taken <i>it</i> upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there? And He said, I will not destroy <i>it,</i> because of the twenty.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. And when Lot saw <i>them,</i> he rose up to meet them and bowed with his face to the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said, Now, my lords, please turn aside here to your servant’s house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you can rise up early and go on your way. But they said, No; we will spend the night in the square.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> But he urged them strongly, and they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> <i>But</i> before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they called to Lot and said to him, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he said, Please, my brothers, do not act <i>so</i> wickedly.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I have here two daughters who have not known a man. Please, let me bring them out to you, and do to them as is fitting in your eyes; only do not do anything to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But they said, Stand aside. Then they said, This one came <i>here</i> to sojourn, and already he is acting like a judge. Now we will treat you worse than <i>we would have</i> them. And they pressed hard against the man, against Lot, and came near in order to break down the door.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But the men stretched out their hand and brought Lot into the house to them and shut the door.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves <i>trying</i> to find the entrance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the men said to Lot, Whom else do you have here? A son-in-law or your sons and your daughters or anyone you have in the city — bring <i>them</i> out of the place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before Jehovah that Jehovah has sent us to destroy it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, Rise up; go forth from this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. But it seemed to his sons-in-law as though he were joking.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, Rise up; take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be destroyed in the iniquity of the city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But he lingered; so the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And when they had brought them outside, He said, Escape for your life. Do not look behind you, neither stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the hills, lest you be destroyed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Lot said to them, May it not be so, Lord;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Even though Your servant has found favor in Your sight, and You have magnified Your lovingkindness, which You have showed to me in preserving my life; I cannot escape to the mountain, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Here, this city is nearby to flee to, and it is a little one. Please let me escape there — is it not a little one? — and I shall live.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And He said to him, I now grant you this request also, that I will not overthrow the city concerning which you have spoken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Hurry, escape there; for I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Abraham rose up early in the morning <i>and went</i> to the place where he had stood before Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he looked down upon Sodom and Gomorrah and upon all the land of the plain. And as he looked, there it was: the smoke of the land was going up like the smoke of a furnace.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out from the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities among which Lot dwelt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Then Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters with him, for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Come, let us make our father drink wine; and let us lie with him, that we may preserve alive seed from our father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And the next day the firstborn said to the younger, I have now lain with my father last night. Let us make him drink wine tonight also; and you go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve alive seed from our father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger one arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And of the son of the maidservant I will also make a nation, because he is your seed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a waterskin <i>full</i> of water and gave <i>them</i> to Hagar, putting <i>them</i> on her shoulder, and <i>gave her</i> the child and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> When the water in the waterskin was finished, she cast the child under one of the bushes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And she went and sat herself down opposite <i>him,</i> a fair distance away, about a bowshot away, for she said, Do not let me look upon the death of the child. And as she sat opposite <i>him,</i> she lifted up her voice and wept.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And God heard the voice of the boy. And the Angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said to her, What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Rise up; lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand, for I will make of him a great nation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the waterskin with water and gave the boy a drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And God was with the boy, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And at that time Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity. According to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall do to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Abraham said, I swear <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Abraham confronted Abimelech concerning the well of water which Abimelech’s servants had taken by force.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing; and you did not tell me <i>about it,</i> nor have I even heard <i>of it</i> until today.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech. And the two of them made a covenant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Abimelech said to Abraham, What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And he said, These seven ewe lambs you shall take from my hand, that it may be a witness for me that I dug this well.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there the two of them swore an oath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; and Abimelech rose up with Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there he called on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now after these things God tested Abraham and said to him, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And He said, Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son. And he split the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went to the place of which God had told him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Abraham said to his young men, Stay here with the donkey; and I and the boy will go over there, and we will worship, and <i>then</i> we will return to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid <i>it</i> upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And the two of them walked together.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, My father! And he said, Here I am, my son. And he said, The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Abraham said, God Himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So the two of them walked on together.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And He said, Do not stretch out your hand upon the boy, nor do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and there behind <i>him</i> was a ram, caught in the thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering in place of his son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh, as it is said <i>to</i> this day, On the mount of Jehovah it will be provided.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham a second time from the heavens<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And said, By Myself I have sworn, declares Jehovah: Because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> I will surely bless you and will greatly multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt in Beer-sheba.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And after these things it was told Abraham, saying, Milcah has now also borne children to your brother Nahor:<br><br>

				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah <i>and</i> which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it and all the trees that were in the field, which were in all its territory, were assured<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Abraham was old <i>and</i> advanced in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put your hand under my thigh;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I will make you swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am dwelling.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But you shall go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from where you came?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Abraham said to him, Be certain not to take my son back there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land, He will send His angel before you; and you shall take a wife for my son from there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And if the woman is not willing to follow you, you shall be free from this oath of mine; only you shall not take my son back there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and departed, having all kinds of his master’s good things in his hand. And he rose up and went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, at the time when women go out to draw <i>water.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show lovingkindness to my master Abraham.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I am standing here by the spring of water as the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And may it be that the girl to whom I say, Please let down your pitcher that I may drink, and who says, Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink, may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant, for Isaac; and in this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, coming out with her pitcher upon her shoulder.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the girl was very beautiful in appearance, a virgin, and no man had known her. And she went down to the spring and filled her pitcher and came up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the servant ran to meet her and said, Please let me sip a little water from your pitcher.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hurried and lowered her pitcher on her hand and gave him a drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, I will draw <i>water</i> for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And she hurried and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again to the well to draw <i>water,</i> and she drew <i>it</i> for all his camels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the man gazed fixedly upon her in silence to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And when the camels had finished drinking, the man took a golden nose-ring weighing half a shekel and two bracelets for her hands weighing ten gold shekels,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And said, Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge in?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> She also said to him, We have plenty of straw and fodder and also a place to lodge.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the man bowed and worshipped Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His lovingkindness and His faithfulness toward my master. As for me, Jehovah has led me in the way to the house of my master’s brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the girl ran and told her mother’s house about these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> As soon as he had seen the nose-ring and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, This is what the man spoke to me, he went to the man. And there he was, standing by the camels at the spring.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And he said, Come in, O blessed of Jehovah! Why do you stand outside when I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And the man came into the house, and Laban unloaded the camels. And he gave straw and fodder to the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And <i>food</i> was set before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat until I have stated my business. And he said, Speak on.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great. And He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master after she had become old. And he has given all that he has to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> But you shall go to my father’s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send His angel with you and make your journey prosperous. And you shall take a wife for my son from my family, even from my father’s house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my family and if they do not give <i>her</i> to you; you will be free from my oath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And I came today to the spring and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now You will only make my journey on which I go prosperous!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> I am standing here by the spring of water, and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw <i>water,</i> to whom I will say, Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And she will say to me, Drink, and I will also draw <i>water</i> for your camels, may she be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my master’s son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Before I had finished speaking in my heart, there came Rebekah, and her pitcher was on her shoulder. And she went down to the spring and drew <i>water.</i> And I said to her, Please let me drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And she hurried and let down her pitcher from her <i>shoulder</i> and said, Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink. So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And I asked her and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the nose-ring upon her nose and the bracelets upon her hands.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> And I bowed and worshipped Jehovah and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me <i>so;</i> but if not, tell me <i>so,</i> that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The matter comes from Jehovah; we cannot speak to you bad or good.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> Here is Rebekah before you: Take <i>her,</i> and go; and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as Jehovah has spoken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>52</b></sup> And when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the earth to Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>53</b></sup> And the servant brought forth silver jewelry and gold jewelry and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>54</b></sup> And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and spent the night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>55</b></sup> And her brother and her mother said, Let the girl stay with us <i>a few</i> days, ten <i>or so;</i> after that she may go.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>56</b></sup> And he said to them, Do not delay me, since Jehovah has made my journey prosperous. Send me away that I may go to my master.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>57</b></sup> And they said, Let us call the girl and ask her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>58</b></sup> And they called Rebekah and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>59</b></sup> So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>60</b></sup> And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,May you, our sister, become / Thousands of ten thousands, / And may your seed possess / The gate of those who hate them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>61</b></sup> And Rebekah arose with her maids, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah and went away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>62</b></sup> Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi, for he was dwelling in the region of the Negev.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>63</b></sup> And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>64</b></sup> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes; and when she saw Isaac, she sprang off the camel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>65</b></sup> And she said to the servant, Who is this man who is walking in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil and covered herself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>66</b></sup> And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>67</b></sup> And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother. And he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after <i>the death of</i> his mother.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister, for he was afraid to say, My wife, <i>thinking,</i> The men of this place might slay me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful in appearance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when he had been there a long time, Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked out through his window and saw, and there was Isaac playfully <i>caressing</i> Rebekah his wife.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Abimelech called Isaac and said, So she is indeed your wife. How then did you say, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I thought I might die on account of her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Isaac sowed in that land and gained in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the man became rich and continued to grow richer until he became very rich.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father the Philistines had stopped up and filled with earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> So Isaac went away from there and camped in the valley of Gerar and dwelt there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Abraham his father and <i>which</i> the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham; and he called them by the same names which his father had given them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of springing water.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac’s shepherds, saying, The water is ours. So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they dug another well; and they strove over that also, so he called the name of it Sitnah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And he moved away from there and dug another well, but they did not strive over it, so he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, Now Jehovah has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he went up from there to Beer-sheba.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Jehovah appeared to him the same night and said, I am the God of Abraham your father. Do not be afraid, for I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your seed for My servant Abraham’s sake.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he built an altar there and called upon the name of Jehovah and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac’s servants dug a well.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the captain of his army.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And they said, We see plainly that Jehovah is with you; so we say, Let there now be an oath between us, <i>even</i> between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> That you will not do us any harm, just as we have not touched you, and just as we have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And they rose up early in the morning and swore to one another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And the same day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well which they had dug and said to him, We have found water.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Now when Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And they caused bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-27">Genesis 27</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now when Isaac was old, and his eyes had become so dim that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, My son. And he said to him, Here I am.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said, Behold now, I am old, <i>and</i> I do not know the day of my death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Now then, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And prepare for me a tasty meal, such as I love, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Now Rebekah had been listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring it <i>home,</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, I just heard your father speaking to Esau your brother, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Bring me game, and prepare for me a tasty meal so that I may eat <i>it</i> and bless you before Jehovah before my death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Go now to the flock, and take two choice kids for me from there, and I will prepare them as a tasty meal for your father, such as he loves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then you shall bring <i>it</i> to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before his death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Perhaps my father will feel me, and I will be as a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And his mother said to him, Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get <i>them</i> for me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he went and got <i>them</i> and brought <i>them</i> to his mother; and his mother prepared a tasty meal, such as his father loved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And she put the skins of the kids on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And she put the tasty meal and the bread that she had prepared into the hand of Jacob her son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And he came to his father and said, My father. And he said, Here I am. Who are you, my son?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Now rise up; sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found <i>it</i> so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah your God put <i>it</i> in my way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Isaac said to Jacob, Please come near that I may feel you, my son, <i>to know</i> whether you are really my son Esau or not.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Jacob came near to Isaac his father. And he felt him and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are Esau’s hands.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And he said, Are you really my son Esau? And he said, I am.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he said, Bring <i>it</i> near to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, that I may bless you. So he brought <i>it</i> near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Then his father Isaac said to him, Please come near and kiss me, my son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> So he came near and kissed him; and when Isaac smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said,See, the smell of my son — / Like the smell of a field / Which Jehovah has blessed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And may God give you / Of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth, / And an abundance of grain and new wine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Let peoples serve you, / And nations bow down to you. / Be lord over your brothers, / And let your mother’s sons bow down to you. / Cursed be those who curse you, / And blessed be those who bless you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And he also had prepared a tasty meal and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, Let my father rise up, and eat some of his son’s game, that you may bless me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And Isaac trembled very greatly and said, Who was it then who hunted game and brought <i>it</i> to me, so that I ate of it all before you came and blessed him? And blessed will he be.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a very great and bitter cry and said to his father, Bless me, <i>even</i> me also, O my father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And he said, Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And Esau said, Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold now he has taken away my blessing. Then he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And Isaac answered and said to Esau, I have already made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. And what then shall I do for you, my son?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And Esau said to his father, Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, <i>even</i> me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And Isaac his father answered and said to him,Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, / And of the dew of heaven from above.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> Yet by your sword shall you live, / And you shall serve your brother. / And when you become restless, / You shall break his yoke from off your neck.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will slay my brother Jacob.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah, so she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, Now your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you <i>by planning</i> to kill you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> Therefore, my son, obey my voice now, and rise up; flee to Laban my brother at Haran,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send <i>word</i> and bring you back from there. Why should I be bereaved of both of you in one day?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth like these, from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-28">Genesis 28</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him; and he charged him and said to him, You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Rise up, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and take from there a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And may the All-sufficient God bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And may He give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, that you may possess <i>this</i> land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramaean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, <i>and that</i> when he blessed him, he charged him, saying, You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased Isaac his father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, <i>and</i> the sister of Nebaioth to be his wife, in addition to the wives that he had.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And he came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set. And he took <i>one</i> of the stones of the place and put <i>it</i> under his head, and he lay down in that place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And there was Jehovah, standing above it; and He said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give to you and to your seed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And, behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will cause you to return to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz previously.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and garments to put on,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> So that I return to my father’s house in peace, then Jehovah will be my God,<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-29">Genesis 29</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the children of the east.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he looked, and there in the field was a well, and there three flocks of sheep were lying beside it; for from that well they watered the flocks. And the stone on the mouth of the well was large.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And when all the flocks would gather there, they would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep; then they would put the stone back on the mouth of the well in its place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jacob said to them, My brothers, where are you from? And they said, We are from Haran.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he said to them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We do know <i>him.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he said to them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well, and here is his daughter Rachel, coming with the sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he said, Look, it is still full day; <i>and</i> it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go feed <i>them.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with the sheep which belonged to her father, for she was a shepherdess.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob drew near and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted up his voice and wept.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative and that he was Rebekah’s son. And she ran and told her father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister’s son, he ran to meet him. And he embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then Jacob related to Laban all these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him a month.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Leah’s eyes were dull, but Rachel was beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man; stay with me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but they seemed to him only a few days because of the love he had for her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then Jacob said to Laban, Give <i>me</i> my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But in the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in to her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Laban gave Zilpah his female servant to his daughter Leah to be her female servant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And in the morning there she was, Leah! And he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Laban said, It is not done in this way in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for another seven years.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Jacob did so and completed her week, and he gave him Rachel his daughter as a wife.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his female servant to be her female servant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And he went in also to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel, more than Leah. And he served with Laban for another seven years.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Now when Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, Because Jehovah has looked upon my affliction, surely now my husband will love me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And she conceived again and bore a son and said, Because Jehovah has heard that I am hated, He has therefore given me this <i>son</i> also; so she called his name Simeon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And she conceived again and bore a son and said, Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And she conceived again and bore a son and said, This time I will praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she ceased bearing.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And she said, Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, that she may bear upon my knees and that I also may have children through her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And she gave him Bilhah her female servant as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son; therefore she called his name Dan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Bilhah Rachel’s female servant conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Rachel said, In wrestling with God, I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed; so she called his name Naphtali.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Now when Leah saw that she ceased bearing, she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Jacob as a wife.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Zilpah Leah’s female servant bore Jacob a son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Leah said, How fortunate! So she called his name Gad.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Zilpah Leah’s female servant bore Jacob a second son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Leah said, Happy am I! For the daughters will call me blessed; so she called his name Asher.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Reuben went out in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? And would you take away my son’s mandrakes also? So Rachel said, Then he may lie with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes. So he lay with her that night.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I gave my female servant to my husband; so she called his name Issachar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons; so she called his name Zebulun.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Then God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And she conceived and bore a son and said, God has taken away my reproach.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And she called his name Joseph, saying, May Jehovah add to me another son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And when Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Give <i>me</i> my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go; for you indeed know my service by which I have served you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Laban said to him, If you please, I have divined that Jehovah has blessed me on account of you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he said, Name me your wages, and I will give it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Jacob said to him, You indeed know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> For you had little before I came, and it has spread into a multitude, and Jehovah has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own house also?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. Just do this <i>one</i> thing for me: Let me again feed your flock and keep <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted animal, that is, every black animal among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such will be my wages.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> So my righteousness will testify for me later, when you come concerning my wages, <i>by what is</i> before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the sheep, <i>if found</i> with me, will be counted stolen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Laban said, Fine; let it be according to your word.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> But on that day Laban removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And he set <i>a distance of a</i> three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And Jacob took rods of fresh poplar and almond and plane trees and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And he set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, <i>that is,</i> in the watering places where the flocks came to drink; and they bred when they came to drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And the flocks bred before the rods; and the flocks brought forth <i>young</i> that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flock toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban, and he put his own herds apart and did not put them with Laban’s flock.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> And whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the flock in the troughs so that they might breed among the rods;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> But when the flock was feebler, he did not put <i>them</i> in; so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> And the man became spread out exceedingly, and had large flocks, and female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-31">Genesis 31</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that belonged to our father; and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Jacob saw Laban’s countenance, and now it was not <i>favorable</i> toward him as previously.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he said to them, I see that your father’s countenance is not <i>favorable</i> toward me as previously, but the God of my father has been with me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you yourselves know that with all my strength I have served your father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to harm me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> If he spoke in this way, The speckled shall be your wages, then all the flock bore speckled; and if he spoke in this way, The streaked shall be your wages, then all the flock bore streaked.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock and given <i>them</i> to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And at the time the flock was breeding, I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream; and there were the male goats, leaping upon the flock — streaked, speckled, and spotted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the Angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob; and I said, Here I am.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And He said, Lift up your eyes now, and see that all the male goats which leap upon the flock are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to Me. Rise up now; go out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father’s house?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us and has even entirely used up the money <i>given</i> for us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father is ours and our children’s. So do now whatever God has said to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had acquired, the livestock in his possession which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, in order to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramaean by not telling him that he was fleeing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> So he fled with all that he had, and he rose up and crossed over the River and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he took his brothers with him and pursued after him <i>the distance of a</i> seven days’ journey; and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And God came to Laban the Aramaean in a dream of the night and said to him, Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his brothers <i>also</i> pitched <i>tents</i> in the hill country of Gilead.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Laban said to Jacob, What are you doing deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Why did you flee secretly and steal away from me and not tell me, when I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with tambourine and with lyre?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have acted foolishly.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And now, though you had to go because you longed greatly for your father’s house, why did you steal my gods?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I thought that you might take your daughters from me by force.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> <i>The</i> <i>one</i> with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our brothers indicate what <i>there is</i> with me <i>that</i> is yours, and take <i>it.</i> Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the two female servants’ tent, but he did not find <i>them.</i> Then he went from Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Now Rachel had taken the teraphim and put them in the camel’s saddle, and she sat upon them. And Laban rummaged through all the tent but did not find <i>them.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before you, for the manner of women is upon me. So he searched but did not find the teraphim.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have <i>so</i> hotly pursued me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> Although you have rummaged through all my possessions, what have you found of all your household goods? Set <i>it</i> here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may decide between the two of us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> These twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> That which was torn <i>by beasts</i> I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> <i>Thus</i> I was: By day the dry heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> These twenty years have I been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac, had not been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked <i>you</i> last night.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> So come now; let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be a witness between me and you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> So Jacob took a stone and set it up <i>as</i> a pillar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones. So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you today. Therefore its name was called Galeed<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> And Mizpah, because he said, Jehovah watch between me and you when we are absent from one another.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> If you afflict my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughters — <i>even though</i> no man is with us — see, God is witness between me and you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> And Laban said to Jacob, Here is this heap, and here is the pillar which I have set between me and you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>52</b></sup> This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you and that you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>53</b></sup> The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Dread of his father Isaac.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>54</b></sup> And Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his brothers to eat a meal, and they ate a meal and spent the night in the mountain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>55</b></sup> And early in the morning Laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them, and Laban departed and returned to his place.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God’s camp. So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the field of Edom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he commanded them, saying, Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And I have oxen and donkeys <i>and</i> flocks, and male servants and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord <i>this,</i> that I may find favor in your sight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you; and four hundred men are with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two camps;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And he said, If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp which is left will escape.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who said to me, Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will do you good,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> I am not worthy of all the lovingkindnesses and all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant; for with my staff <i>only</i> I crossed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack me <i>and</i> the mother with the children.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But You have said, I will surely do you good and make your seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he spent that night there. Then from what he had with him he took a present for Esau his brother:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Thirty nursing camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he delivered <i>them</i> into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Cross over before me, and put a space between each drove.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong? And where are you going? And whose <i>animals</i> are these before you?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then you will say, Your servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent to my lord Esau; and now he also is behind us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And he commanded also the second and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this way you shall speak to Esau when you find him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And you shall also say, Your servant Jacob is right behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> So the present crossed over before him, and he himself spent that night in the camp.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two female servants and his eleven children and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over what he had.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And when the man saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated as he wrestled with Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the man said, Let Me go, for the dawn is breaking. But Jacob said, I will not let You go unless You bless me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And He said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Jacob asked <i>Him</i> and said, Please tell <i>me</i> Your name. But He said, Why is it that you ask My name? And He blessed him there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for, <i>he said,</i> I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been preserved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the sun rose upon him as he crossed over Penuel, and he limped because of his hip.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the thigh muscle, which is upon the socket of the hip, to this day, because He touched the socket of Jacob’s hip at the thigh muscle.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and there was Esau coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and among Rachel and among the two female servants.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he put the female servants and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he himself passed on before them and bowed down to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given your servant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then the female servants came near, they and their children, and they bowed down.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed down.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Esau said, What do you mean by all this camp which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jacob said, No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then take my present from my hand; for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Please take my blessing which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have all <i>that I need.</i> So he urged him, and he took <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then Esau said, Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are frail and that the nursing flocks and herds are a concern to me; and if they overdrive them for one day, all the flock will die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Let my lord please pass on before his servant, and I will lead on slowly according to the pace of the cattle which are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> So Esau said, Let me please leave with you some of the people who are with me. And he said, What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built a house for himself and made booths for his livestock; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and he camped before the city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And he bought the piece of land, where he had pitched his tent, from the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her and humbled her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And his soul clung to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke affectionately to the girl.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this young girl as a wife.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Now when Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob kept silent until they came in.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard of <i>it.</i> And the men were grieved and became very angry, because he had committed folly in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him as a wife.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And make marriages with us: Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And you shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you; dwell and trade in it, and acquire holdings in it.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Impose upon me a very large bridal price and gift, and I will give whatever you say to me; but give me the girl as a wife.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully; and because he had defiled Dinah their sister, they spoke<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And said to them, We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach to us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Only on this <i>condition</i> will we consent to you: If you become like us, and every male among you is circumcised,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then we will give our daughters to you and will take your daughters for ourselves; and we will dwell with you and become one people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And their words seemed good to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob’s daughter. Now he was honored above all the house of his father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city and spoke with the men of their city, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> These men are with us peacefully; therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for here the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters for ourselves as wives, and let us give them our daughters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Only on this <i>condition</i> will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then on the third day, when they were <i>still</i> in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city unawares, and slew every male.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and they took Dinah out of Shechem’s house and went away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys and whatever was in the city and whatever was in the field;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And they took captive and plundered all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, and even all that was in the houses.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have brought trouble upon me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I am few in number, and they will gather themselves together against me and strike me; and I will be destroyed, I and my house.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And as her soul was departing (for she died), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Jacob set up a pillar on her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave, <i>which is there</i> to this day.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-37">Genesis 37</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Canaan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, when he was seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers while he was <i>still</i> a youth, with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives. And Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because he was the son of his old age, and he had made him a coat of many colors.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then Joseph had a dream; and when he told <i>it</i> to his brothers, they hated him even more.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he said to them, Listen to this dream which I have had:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> There we were, binding sheaves in the field, when suddenly my sheaf rose up and remained standing; and then your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And his brothers said to him, Will you indeed reign over us and actually be a ruler among us? So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And he had still another dream and told it to his brothers and said, Now I have had another dream: There were the sun and the moon and eleven stars, bowing down to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he told <i>it</i> to his father and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, What is this dream that you have had? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the ground to you?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying <i>in his heart.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then his brothers went to shepherd their father’s flock in Shechem.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Israel said to Joseph, Your brothers are now shepherding <i>the flock</i> in Shechem. Come, and I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I am.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he said to him, Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flock, and bring word back to me. So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And a man found him; and there he was, wandering in the field, and the man asked him, saying, What are you seeking?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he said, I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are shepherding <i>the flock.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the man said, They have moved on from here; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And when they saw him from a distance and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to put him to death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And they said one to another, Here comes this master of dreams.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Now then, come and let us slay him and throw him into one of the pits; and we will say, A wild beast has devoured him; then we will see what will become of his dreams.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> But when Reuben heard <i>it,</i> he tried to deliver him out of their hand and said, Let us not take his life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him — that he might deliver him out of their hand to restore him to his father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty; there was no water in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then they sat down to eat food; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and there was a caravan of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, going to carry <i>it</i> down to Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Then Judah said to his brothers, What gain is there if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let our hand not be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers listened <i>to him.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> So when some Midianite traders passed by, they pulled Joseph up, lifting <i>him</i> out of the pit, and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty <i>pieces</i> of silver. And <i>these</i> brought Joseph into Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And when Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And he returned to his brothers and said, The boy is not <i>there;</i> so as for me, what shall I do?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Then they took Joseph’s coat and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the coat in the blood.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And they sent the coat of many colors and had it brought to their father and said, We found this; please examine <i>it, and see</i> whether it is your son’s coat or not.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And he recognized it and said, It is my son’s coat. A wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted and said, Surely I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning. Thus his father wept for him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-38">Genesis 38</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched <i>his tent</i> near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Judah saw there the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her and went in to her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And yet again she bore a son and called his name Shelah, and she was in Chezib when she bore him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah put him to death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up seed to your brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But since Onan knew that the seed would not be his, whenever he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled <i>it</i> on the ground, so that he would not give seed to his brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But what he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, so He put him to death also.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father’s house until Shelah my son grows up. For he thought, He also may die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And in process of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And it was told to Tamar, saying, Your father-in-law is now going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And she removed from herself her widow’s garments and covered <i>herself</i> with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as <i>his</i> wife.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he turned aside to her by the way and said, Come now, let me come in to you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he said, I will send <i>you</i> a kid from the flock. And she said, Only if you give me a pledge until you send <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your seal and your cord and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave <i>them</i> to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And she arose and went away, and removed her veil from herself and put on her widow’s garments.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand; but he did not find her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute who was by the road at Enaim? And they said, There has been no prostitute here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And he returned to Judah and said, I did not find her; and also the men of the place said, There has been no prostitute here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Judah said, Let her keep <i>the things</i> for herself, lest we become a laughing stock; you see, I sent <i>her</i> this kid, but you did not find her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And about three months later it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; moreover, now she is pregnant by harlotry. And Judah said, Bring her out, and let her be burned.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> As she was being brought out, she sent <i>word</i> to her father-in-law, saying, I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong. And she said, Please note whose these are, the seal and the cords and the staff.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Judah took note <i>of them</i> and said, She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to my son Shelah. And he did not know her again anymore.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And at the time of her delivery, there were twins in her womb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And while she was giving birth, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, This one came out first.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> But when he drew back his hand, his brother suddenly came out; and she said, What a breach you have made for yourself! Therefore his name was called Perez.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and his name was called Zerah.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he became a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and that Jehovah caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered to him; and he made him overseer of his house and put all that he had in his charge.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And from the time he made him overseer in his house and <i>put him</i> over all that he had, Jehovah blessed the Egyptian’s house on account of Joseph; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he left all that he had in Joseph’s charge; and with him <i>there,</i> he was not concerned about anything except the food that he ate. And Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Now after these things his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, Lie with me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But he refused and said to his master’s wife, Behold, with me <i>here,</i> my master is not concerned about anything in the house, and he has put everything he has in my charge.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her to lie beside her <i>or</i> be with her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And one such day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were there in the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And she grabbed him by his garment, saying, Lie with me! But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and went outside.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> She called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew man to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I called out with a loud voice;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And she placed his garment beside her until his master came home.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And she spoke to him with these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And when I lifted up my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And when his master heard the words of his wife that she had spoken to him, saying, This is the way your servant treated me; his anger burned.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while he was there in the prison,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I put the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Joseph said to him, This is its interpretation: The three branches are three days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand according to your former custom when you were his cupbearer.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Now when the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also <i>saw this</i> in my dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Joseph answered and said, This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then there were seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, that sprouted after them.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then there came up after them seven other cows, poor and very ugly-looking and thin-fleshed; I had never seen such in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the thin and ugly-looking <i>cows</i> ate up the first seven fat cows.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And when they had swallowed them, no one would have known that they had swallowed them, for they were still as ugly-looking as at the beginning. Then I awoke.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And I saw <i>this</i> in my dream: There were seven ears of grain, coming up on one stalk, full and good.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then there were seven ears, withered, thin, <i>and</i> scorched by the east wind, that sprouted after them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told <i>it</i> to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain <i>it</i> to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, Pharaoh’s dream is one <i>dream;</i> what God is about to do He has told Pharaoh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the seven thin and ugly-looking <i>cows</i> that came up after them are seven years, and so <i>are the</i> seven empty ears scorched by the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> This matter is just as I have spoken to Pharaoh; what God is about to do He has shown to Pharaoh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Seven years of great abundance are now about to come throughout all the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Then seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will consume the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that famine which follows, for it will be very severe.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, <i>it means</i> that the matter is determined by God, and God will quickly bring it about.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out for a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth <i>of the produce</i> of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And let them gather all the food of these coming good years and lay up grain under Pharaoh’s authority for food in the cities, and let them keep <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And let the food become a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that will be in the land of Egypt, so that the land does not perish in the famine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And the word seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a man like this, in whom the Spirit of God is?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God let you know all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> You shall be over my household, and according to your word all my people shall be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> And he made him ride in the chariot of his second-in-command, <i>and</i> they cried out before him, Bow the knee! And he set him over all the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, yet without your consent no man will lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and passed through all the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And in the seven years of abundance the earth produced copiously.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which came upon the land of Egypt and put the food in the cities; he placed the food from the surrounding fields within each city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> And Joseph stored grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea until he stopped measuring <i>it;</i> for it was beyond measure.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> And before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, for, <i>he said,</i> God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>52</b></sup> And he called the name of the second Ephraim, for, <i>he said,</i> God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>53</b></sup> And the seven years of abundance that came upon the land of Egypt came to an end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>54</b></sup> And the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>55</b></sup> So when all the land of Egypt became hungry, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>56</b></sup> And when the famine was over all the face of the earth, Joseph opened all the storehouses of grain and sold grain to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>57</b></sup> And all the earth came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-42">Genesis 42</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now when Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do you keep looking at one another?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said, I have now heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there, and buy grain for us from there, that we may live and not die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> So Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, Perhaps harm may befall him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the sons of Israel came to buy grain among <i>the others</i> who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Now Joseph was the governor over the land; it was he who sold grain to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down to him with <i>their</i> faces to the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke harshly with them. And he said to them, Where have you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to buy grain for food.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they said to him, No, my lord; rather your servants have come to buy grain for food.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> We are all sons of one man. We are honest men; your servants have never been spies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he said to them, No; but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And they said, We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and at this moment the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But Joseph said to them, It is just as I spoke to you, saying, You are spies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> By this you shall be tested: As Pharaoh lives, you shall not go away from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Send one of you to get your brother while you remain bound, that your words may be tested whether there is truth in you. And if not, as Pharaoh lives, surely you are spies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he put them all together in custody three days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Joseph said to them on the third day, Do this and live, <i>for</i> I fear God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> If you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain bound in your place of custody; and <i>the rest of</i> you go, carry grain for the famine of your households.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And bring your youngest brother to me, that your words may be verified; and you will not die. And they did so.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they said one to another, We are indeed guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; therefore this distress has come to us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the child? But you would not listen. So now also his blood is required.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And they did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And he turned away from them and wept. Then he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man’s silver pieces to his sack and to give them provisions for the way. And thus was it done for them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And they loaded their grain upon their donkeys and departed from there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And one <i>of them</i> opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, and he saw his silver; there it was in the mouth of his sack.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he said to his brothers, My silver has been returned; and here it is in my sack! And their heart stopped, and they <i>turned</i> trembling to one another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and took us for spies on the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> But we said to him, We are honest men; we have never been spies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; the one is no more, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this will I know that you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me, and take <i>grain</i> for the famine of your households, and go.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies but honest men. I will give you your brother, and you may trade in the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And when they emptied their sacks, there was each man’s bundle of silver pieces, in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of silver, they were afraid.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin; all these things are against me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, You may put to death my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Put him in my hand, and I will return him to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. And if harm should befall him on the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-43">Genesis 43</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now the famine was severe in the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And when they had completely consumed the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go back; buy us a little food.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> But Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly warned us, saying, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> If you are willing to send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you grain for food;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But if you are not willing to send <i>him,</i> we will not go down; for the man said to us, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And they said, The man asked very carefully about us and about our relatives, saying, Is your father still alive? Do you have <i>another</i> brother? So we told him about these things. Could we possibly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the boy with me, and we will rise up and go, that we may live and not die, we and you and our little ones.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I myself will be surety for him; of my hand you may require him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then I shall bear the blame of sinning before you forever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> For if we had not delayed, by now we could have returned twice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And their father Israel said to them, If it <i>must be</i> so, then do this: Take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man — a little balm and a little honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And take double the silver in your hand, and carry back in your hand the silver that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Take your brother also, and rise up; return to the man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And may the All-sufficient God grant you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am to be bereaved of my children, I shall be bereaved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> So the men took this present, and they took double the silver in their hand and Benjamin; and they rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to him who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and prepare <i>it;</i> for the men will eat with me at noon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, <i>It is</i> because of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are being brought in, that he may come out against us and fall upon us and take us as slaves with our donkeys.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And they came near to the man who was over Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the door of the house,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And said, Please, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy grain for food;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And when we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and there was each man’s silver, in the mouth of his sack, our silver in full weight. So we have brought it back in our hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And we have also brought down extra silver in our hand to buy grain for food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he said, Be at peace; do not fear. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; your silver came to me. Then he brought Simeon out to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave <i>them</i> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And they prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they would eat a meal there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed down to the ground to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And he asked them about their welfare and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And they said, Your servant our father is well; he is still alive. And they bowed and paid <i>him</i> homage.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Joseph hurried — for his inward parts burned for his brother — and sought <i>a place</i> to weep. So he entered into his chamber and wept there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Then he washed his face and came out, and he controlled himself and said, Serve the meal.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat a meal with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And he had portions brought to them from before him; however Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.<br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="genesis-44">Genesis 44</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And he commanded him who was over his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest with his silver for the grain. And he did <i>so,</i> according to the word that Joseph had spoken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> When they had <i>just</i> gone out of the city <i>and</i> were not yet far off, Joseph said to him who was over his house, Rise up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you repaid evil for good?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Is not this that from which my lord drinks, and which he indeed uses for divining? You have done wrong in so doing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he overtook them and spoke these words to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> See <i>how</i> we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die; and we ourselves will become my lord’s slaves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: He with whom it is found will be my slave, and <i>the rest of</i> you will be blameless.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then each man hurried and lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then they tore their garments, and each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Judah said, What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Here we are, my lord’s slaves, both we and the one in whose hand the cup has been found.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> But he said, Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose hand the cup has been found, he will be my slave; but as for <i>the rest of</i> you, go up in peace to your father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then Judah came near to him and said, Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> My lord asked his servants, saying, Do you have a father or a brother?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And we said to my lord, The boy cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, <i>his father</i> would die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And you said to your servants, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And when we went up to your servant my father, we told him my lord’s words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And our father said, Return, buy us a little food.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> But we said, We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, we will go down; for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the one went away from me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I have not seen him to this day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And if you take this one also from me and harm befalls him, you will bring down my gray hairs in misery to Sheol.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, his life being bound up in the boy’s life,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> When he sees that the boy is not <i>with us,</i> he will die; and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father in sorrow to Sheol.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, then I shall bear the blame of sinning before my father forever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Now therefore, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go up with his brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> For how shall I go up to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would come on my father.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who attended him; and he cried out, Have everyone go out from me. So there was no one standing with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard <i>it,</i> and the household of Pharaoh heard <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph! Is my father still alive? But his brothers could not answer him, so troubled were they at his presence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Joseph said to his brothers, Please come closer to me. And they came closer. And he said, I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For the famine has been in the midst of the land these two years, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; do not delay.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen and be near to me, you and your children and your children’s children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And there I will sustain you — for there are still five years of famine <i>to come</i> — so that you and your household and all that you have do not become impoverished.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin <i>see,</i> that it is my own mouth that speaks to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And you must tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that you have seen, and you must hurry and bring my father down here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them, and after that his brothers talked with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And when the report was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brothers have come, it was pleasing to Pharaoh and to his servants.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Do this: Load your beasts, and depart; go to the land of Canaan;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And take your father and your households, and come to me. And I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And you are commanded, Do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives; and bring your father, and come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And do not be concerned for your possessions, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the sons of Israel did so, and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh and gave them provisions for the way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> To each of them he gave changes of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred <i>pieces of</i> silver and five changes of garments.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he sent to his father the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, and bread and provision for his father on the way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> So he sent his brothers away; and as they departed, he said to them, Do not quarrel on the way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And they told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart grew numb, for he did not believe them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He said, I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make of you a great nation there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will also surely bring you up again; and Joseph’s hand will close your eyes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And they took their livestock and their possessions, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> His sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his offspring he brought with him to Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came to Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn, Reuben.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puvah and Iob and Shimron.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, along with his daughter Dinah. His sons and his daughters were thirty-three persons in all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the sons of Asher: Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore these to Jacob, sixteen persons.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bore to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob, fourteen persons in all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the sons of Dan: Hushim.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob, seven persons in all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides the wives of Jacob’s sons, were sixty-six persons in all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he sent Judah before him to Joseph to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came to the land of Goshen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Joseph made his chariot ready and went up to Goshen to meet Israel his father. And when he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Israel said to Joseph, Let me die now since I have seen your face <i>and know</i> that you are still alive.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And when Pharaoh calls you and says, What is your occupation?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> You shall say, Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers; that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.<br><br>
			</p>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="genesis-47">Genesis 47</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh and said, My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and now they are in the land of Goshen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land because there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know any capable men among them, make them overseers over my livestock.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the years of your life?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The years of my sojourning are one hundred thirty years; few and evil have been the years of my life, and they have not attained to the years of the lives of my fathers during the days of their sojourning.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went forth from Pharaoh’s presence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Joseph sustained his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food according to <i>the number of</i> their little ones.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And there was no food in all the land, for the famine was so very severe that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when the money from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan had been spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph saying, Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For <i>our</i> money is gone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Joseph said, Bring your livestock, and I will give you <i>food</i> in exchange for your livestock, if <i>your</i> money is gone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and for the flocks of sheep and for the herds of cattle and for the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And when that year had ended, they came to him the second year and said to him, We cannot hide from my lord that our money has been spent, and the herds of cattle are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord except our bodies and our lands.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will become servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them; and the land became Pharaoh’s.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and they lived off their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then Joseph said to the people, Now that I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you that you may sow the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And when harvest comes, you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own as seed of the field and as food for you and for those of your households and as food for your little ones.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And they said, You have saved our lives. May we find favor in the sight of my lord and be Pharaoh’s servants.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt <i>that stands</i> to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh’s.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they acquired possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. Thus the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And the time for Israel to die drew near. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and truth. Please do not bury me in Egypt;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> But when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself at the head of his bed.<br><br>
			</p>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="genesis-48">Genesis 48</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now after these things Joseph was told, Your father is sick. So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And someone told Jacob and said, Your son Joseph is coming to you. So Israel strengthened himself and sat up on his bed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jacob said to Joseph, The All-sufficient God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And He said to me, Behold, I am going to make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And your offspring whom you beget after them will be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, while there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, Who are these?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given to me here. And he said, Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, and he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Israel said to Joseph, I never expected to see your face, and now God has let me see your seed also.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Joseph brought them out from between his knees and bowed himself with his face to the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid <i>it</i> upon Ephraim’s head — although he was the younger — and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands with insight, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he blessed Joseph and said, / The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, / The God who has shepherded me all my life to this day,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; / And may my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; / And may they be a teeming multitude in the midst of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head onto Manasseh’s head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand upon his head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And he blessed them that day, saying,By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, / God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.Thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Israel said to Joseph, Now I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Moreover I have given to you one portion more than your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.<br><br>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="genesis-49">Genesis 49</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jacob called to his sons and said, Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what will happen to you in the last days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Assemble yourselves, and listen, O sons of Jacob; / Yes, listen to Israel your father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Reuben, you are my firstborn, / My might and the firstfruits of my vigor, / Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Ebullient as water, you will not have the preeminence, / Because you went up to your father’s bed; / Then you defiled <i>it</i> — he went up to my couch.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Simeon and Levi are brothers; / Weapons of violence are their swords.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Come not into their council, O my soul; / Be not united with their assembly, O my glory; / For in their anger they slew men, / And in their self-will they hamstrung oxen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; / And their wrath, for it is cruel: / I will divide them in Jacob, / And scatter them in Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Judah, your brothers will praise you; / Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; / Your father’s sons will bow down before you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Judah is a young lion; / From the prey, my son, you have gone up. / He couches, he stretches out like a lion, / And like a lioness; who will rouse him up?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> The scepter will not depart from Judah, / Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, / Until Shiloh comes, / And to Him shall be the obedience of the peoples.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Binding his foal to the vine, / And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, / He washes his garment in wine, / And his robe in the blood of grapes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Dark are his eyes with wine, / And white are his teeth with milk.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the sea, / And he will be a shore for ships, / And his flank will be toward Sidon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Issachar is a strong donkey, / Couching between the sheepfolds.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he saw a resting place that was good / And the land that was pleasant, / And he bowed his shoulder to bear, / And became a task-worker to <i>bring</i> tribute.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Dan will judge his people, / As one of the tribes of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Dan will be a serpent in the way, / A viper on the path, / That bites the horse’s heels, / So that his rider falls backward.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> I have waited for Your salvation, O Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Gad, raiders will raid him, / But he will raid at their heel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Asher’s food will be rich, / And he will yield royal dainties.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Naphtali is a hind let loose; / He gives beautiful words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Joseph is a fruitful bough, / A fruitful bough by a fountain; / <i>His</i> branches run over the wall.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> The archers bitterly attacked him, / And shot <i>at him</i> and harassed him;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> But his bow remained firm, / And the arms of his hands were agile, / By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob — / From there is the Shepherd, the stone of Israel —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> From the God of your father, who will help you, / And from the All-sufficient One, who will bless you / With blessings of heaven above, / Blessings of the deep that lies beneath, / Blessings of the breasts and of the womb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> The blessings of your father surpass / The blessings of my ancestors / To the utmost bound of the everlasting hills. / They will be on the head of Joseph, / And on the crown of the head of the one who was separate from his brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, / In the morning devouring the prey / And in the evening dividing the spoil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them when he blessed them; he blessed them, each one according to his blessing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And he charged them and said to them, I am being gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite for the possession of a burial place —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> The field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the children of Heth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And when Jacob had finished charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed and expired, and he was gathered to his people.<br><br>

			<h4 id="genesis-50">Genesis 50</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face and wept over him and kissed him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And forty days were spent for this, for this is the time to be spent for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And when the days of weeping for him had passed, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> My father made me swear, saying, Now I am about to die; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me. Now therefore please let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Joseph went up to bury his father; and all the servants of Pharaoh went up with him, the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of Egypt,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And all the house of Joseph and his brothers and his father’s household; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And chariots also went up with him, as well as horsemen; and it was a very great company.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation; and he observed seven days of mourning for his father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And thus his sons did to him as he commanded them;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre, which Abraham had bought with the field for a possession of a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, What if Joseph bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the evil which we did to him?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And they sent a message to Joseph, saying, Your father charged before he died, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Thus shall you say to Joseph, Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong. So now please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And his brothers also went and fell down before him and said, We are here as your servants.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Even though you intended evil against me, God intended it for good, to do as it is this day, to preserve alive a numerous people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Now therefore do not be afraid; I will sustain you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s household; and Joseph lived one hundred ten years.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation; the children of Machir the son of Manasseh were also born on Joseph’s knees.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Joseph said to his brothers, I am about to die, but God will surely visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Joseph made the children of Israel swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall bring my bones up from here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.<br><br>
