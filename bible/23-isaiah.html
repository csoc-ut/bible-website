			<h2>Isaiah</h2>


			<h4 id="isaiah-1">1</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, the kings of Judah:<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Hear, O heavens, and hearken, O earth, / For Jehovah has spoken: / I have brought up children, and I have raised <i>them;</i> / And <i>yet</i> they have rebelled against Me.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> The ox knows his owner, / And the donkey, his master’s manger; / <i>But</i> Israel does not know, / My people do not much consider.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Alas, sinful nation, / A people heavy with iniquity, / Seed of evildoers, / Children acting corruptly! / They have forsaken Jehovah; / They have despised the Holy One of Israel; / They have become estranged <i>and have gone</i> backward.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Where will you be stricken again? / Will you continue <i>your</i> apostasy? / The whole head has become sick, / And the whole heart faint;<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> From the sole of the foot even to the head, / There is no soundness in it, / <i>Only</i> bruises and blows / And raw wounds — / They have not been pressed out nor bound up / Nor softened with oil.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Your land is a desolation; / Your cities are burned with fire; / Your field — in your sight / Strangers devour it; / It is a desolation, like something overthrown by strangers.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And the daughter of Zion is left / Like a booth in a vineyard, / Like a hut in a cucumber field, / Like a besieged city.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Unless Jehovah of hosts / Had left to us a surviving few, / We would have been like Sodom, / We would have resembled Gomorrah.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Hear the word of Jehovah, / You rulers of Sodom; / Hearken to the instruction of our God, / You people of Gomorrah.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> What is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? / Says Jehovah. / I have had My fill of burnt offerings of rams / And the fat of fed cattle; / The blood of bulls and lambs / And goats, I do not delight in.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> When you come to appear before Me, / Who has required this of your hand, / To trample My courts?<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Bring no more vain offerings; / Incense is an abomination to Me. / New moon and Sabbath, the calling of convocations — / I cannot bear iniquity and the solemn assembly.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Your new moons and your appointed feasts / My soul hates; / They have become a burden on Me; / I am weary of bearing <i>them.</i><br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Thus, when you spread forth your hands, / I will hide My eyes from you; / Even though you multiply <i>your</i> prayers, / I will not hear. / Your hands are full of blood;<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Wash yourselves; cleanse yourselves. / Turn away the evil of your deeds / From before My eyes. / Cease doing what is evil;<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Learn to do good. / Seek justice; / Correct the ruthless. / Defend the orphan; / Plead for the widow.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Come now and let us reason together, / Says Jehovah. / Though your sins are like scarlet, / They will be as white as snow; / Though they are as red as crimson, / They will be like wool.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> If you are willing and listen, / You will eat the good of the land;<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> But if you refuse and rebel, / You will be devoured by the sword; / For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> How the faithful city / Has become a harlot! / She who was full of justice, / She in whom righteousness <i>once</i> lodged, / But now murderers!<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Your silver has become dross; / Your wine diluted with water;<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Your rulers are rebellious / And companions of thieves; / They all love bribes / And chase after rewards; / They do not defend the orphan, / Nor does the widow’s plea come before them.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Hence, the Lord Jehovah of hosts, / The Mighty One of Israel, declares: / Ah, I will ease Myself of My adversaries, / And I will avenge Myself of My enemies;<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> And I will turn My hand against you. / I will thoroughly purge away your dross as with lye, / And I will remove all your alloy.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> And I will restore your judges as at the first / And your counselors as at the beginning. / Afterward you will be called the city of righteousness, / The faithful city.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Zion will be ransomed with justice, / And her returning ones with righteousness.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> And <i>there will be</i> the shattering of rebels and sinners together, / And those who forsake Jehovah will meet their end.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> For you will be ashamed of the terebinths / That you have taken pleasure in; / And you will be embarrassed at the gardens / That you have chosen.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> For you will be like a terebinth / Whose leaves are falling, / And like a garden / In which there is no water;<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> And the strong man will become tow, / And his work a spark; / And they will both burn together, / And there will be none to extinguish <i>them.</i><br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> But in the last days / The mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established / On the top of the mountains; / And it will be lifted up above the hills; / And all the nations will stream to it,<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And many peoples will come and say, / Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, / To the house of the God of Jacob, / That He may instruct us in His ways, / And that we may walk in His paths. / For from Zion will go forth instruction, / And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And He will judge between the nations, / And will decide <i>matters</i> for many peoples. / And they will beat their swords into plowshares, / And their spears into pruning knives; / Nation will not lift up sword against nation, / Nor will they learn war anymore.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> For You have abandoned Your people, / The house of Jacob; / Because they are full of <i>customs from</i> the east, / And they are soothsayers like the Philistines, / And they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Their land is full of silver and gold, / And their treasures are limitless; / Their land is also full of horses, / And their chariots are limitless.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And their land is full of idols; / They bow down to the work of their hands, / To that which their fingers have made.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased — / But do not forgive them.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Enter into the rock, / And hide in the dust, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Man’s haughty look will be abased, / And the loftiness of men will be humbled; / But Jehovah alone will be exalted / In that day.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> For Jehovah of hosts will have a day / Over everything proud and lofty, / And over everything lifted up that it may be abased;<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Over all the cedars of Lebanon, / Which are lofty and lifted up, / And over all the oaks of Bashan;<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Over all the lofty mountains, / And over all the hills that are lifted up;<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Over every high tower, / And over every fortified wall;<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Over all the ships of Tarshish, / And over all their pleasant artifacts.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> And the haughtiness of the ordinary man will be humbled, / And the loftiness of the men of distinction will be abased; / But Jehovah alone will be exalted / In that day.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And the idols will vanish completely.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And <i>men</i> will go into caves in the rocks / And into holes in the dust, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty, / When He arises to make the earth tremble.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> In that day a man will cast / His idols of silver and his idols of gold, / Which they made for themselves to bow down to, / To the moles and to the bats,<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> So that they may go into the crevices of the rocks / And into the clefts of the cliffs, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty, / When He arises to make the earth tremble.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Stop regarding man, / Whose <i>life</i> breath is in his nostrils. / For of what <i>value</i> is he considered to be?<br>

			<h4 id="isaiah-3">3</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> For now the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah / Every kind of support — / All the support of bread / And all the support of water;<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> The mighty man and the man of war, / The judge and the prophet, / And the diviner and the elder;<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> The captain of fifty and the highly regarded; / And the counselor, the wise magician, and the knowledgeable enchanter.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And I will make youths their rulers, / And capriciousness will rule over them.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> And the people will be oppressed, each by the other, / And each by his neighbor. / The youth will be arrogant to the elder, / And the contemned one to the one who is honored.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> When a man takes hold of his brother / In his father’s house <i>and says,</i> / You have clothing, you be our ruler, / And these ruins will be under your hand;<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> He will solemnly say, / I will not be the one who binds <i>your wounds,</i> / For in my house there is no food or clothing; / Do not appoint me as ruler of the people.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> For Jerusalem stumbles, / And Judah falls, / Because their speech and their actions are against Jehovah, / To rebel against the eyes of His glory.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> The countenance of their faces witnesses against them, / And they declare their sin like Sodom; / They do not hide it. / Woe to their soul! / For they have brought evil upon themselves.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Say to the righteous that <i>it will go</i> well <i>with them,</i> / For they will eat the fruit of their actions.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Woe to the wicked man! <i>It will go</i> badly <i>with him;</i> / For the result of his deeds will be done to him.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> My people — their oppressors are children, / And women rule over them. / O My people, those who lead you are leading you astray; / And the path for your ways they have hidden.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Jehovah stands firm to contend, / And He stands to judge the people.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Jehovah will enter into judgment / With the elders of His people and their rulers. / <i>It is</i> you <i>who</i> have consumed the vineyard; / The spoil of the poor is in your houses.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> What do you mean by crushing My people / And grinding the faces of the poor? / Declares the Lord Jehovah of hosts.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Moreover Jehovah said, / Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, / And walk around with outstretched necks / And lusting eyes, / And trip along with quick, little steps, / And rattle the anklets on their feet;<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> The Lord will strike the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs, / And Jehovah will expose their secret parts.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> In that day the Lord will remove the beauty of <i>their</i> anklets, headbands, and crescents;<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> The ear pendants, the bracelets, and the costly veils;<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> The headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the bottles of aromas, and the amulets;<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> The <i>finger</i> rings and the nose rings;<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> The formal gowns, the frocks, the wraps, and the purses;<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> The mirrors, the fine linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> And instead of a sweet smell there will be rottenness; / And instead of a belt, an encircling rope; / Instead of well-set hair, baldness; / And instead of fine garments, the girding of oneself with sackcloth; / A brand instead of beauty.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Your men will fall by the sword, / And your mighty, in battle;<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> Then her gates will mourn and lament, / And she, being desolated, will sit on the ground.<br>
			</p>

		<div class="desc">
			<h4 id="isaiah-4">4</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> And seven women will grasp / One man in that day, / Saying, We will eat our own bread / And wear our own clothes; / Just let us bear your name; / Take away our reproach.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> In that day the Shoot of Jehovah will be beauty and glory, and the fruit of the earth, excellence and splendor, to those of Israel who have escaped.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And he who is left over in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been written down in Jerusalem for life;<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and has cleansed away the bloodstains of Jerusalem from her midst, by the judging Spirit and the burning Spirit.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Jehovah will create over the entire region of Mount Zion and over all her convocations a cloud of smoke by day, and the brightness of a fiery flame by night; for the glory will be a canopy over all.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And there will be a tabernacle as a daytime shade from the heat and as a refuge and a cover from storm and rain.<br>

			<h4 id="isaiah-5">5</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> Let me sing of my Beloved, / A song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. / My Beloved had a vineyard / On a fertile hill.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And He dug it up and cleared away its stones, / And He planted it with the choicest vine. / Then He built a tower in the middle of it, / And hewed out a wine vat in it. / And He looked for it to produce grapes, / But it produced <i>only</i> wild grapes.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> So then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem / And you men of Judah, / Judge between Me / And My vineyard.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> What more could I have done for My vineyard / That I have not <i>already</i> done for it? / Why then, when I looked for it to produce grapes, / Did it produce <i>only</i> wild grapes?<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> And now I will make known to you / What I will now do to My vineyard: / I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed; / I will break down its wall, and it will become a trampled place.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And I will make it a waste; / It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed; / But thorns and thistles will come <i>on it.</i> / And I will command the clouds / Not to rain upon it.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, / And the men of Judah, the plant of His good pleasure; / And He expected justice, but instead, bloodshed! / <i>He expected</i> righteousness, but instead, an outcry of distress!<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Woe to those who join house to house, / Who lay field to field, / Till there is no place left, / And you dwell alone in the midst of the land!<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> In my ears Jehovah of hosts <i>has sworn:</i> / Many houses shall indeed become desolate; / Great ones and fine ones <i>shall be</i> without inhabitants.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> For ten acres of vineyard will produce a <i>mere</i> bath <i>of wine,</i> / And a homer of seed will produce an ephah <i>of grain.</i><br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Woe to those who rise early in the morning / That they may run after liquor, / To those who linger into the evening / That wine may inflame them!<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Lyre and harp, tambourine and flute, / And wine are <i>the essence of</i> their banquets; / And they do not consider what has been done by Jehovah, / Nor do they regard the work of His hands.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Hence, my people go into exile / For lack of knowledge; / Their nobility <i>become</i> famished men, / And their multitudes, parched with thirst.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Hence, Sheol enlarges its appetite / And opens its mouth wide, without limit, / And <i>Jerusalem’s</i> splendor descends, and her din / And her uproar and the jubilant within her.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased; / And the eyes of the haughty are abased;<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> But Jehovah of hosts is exalted in judgment, / And the holy God shows Himself holy in righteousness.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Then lambs will graze <i>there</i> as in their pasture, / And strangers will eat the wastelands of fat men.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Woe to those who draw iniquity with ropes of vanity, / And sin as with cart ropes;<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Who say, He should hurry up; / He should hasten His work, / So that we may see <i>it;</i> / And the counsel of the Holy One of Israel / Should draw near and happen, / So that we may know <i>it!</i><br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Woe to those who call evil good, / And good evil; / Who put darkness for light, / And light for darkness; / Who put bitter for sweet, / And sweet for bitter!<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, / And prudent in their own sight!<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine, / And men of valor in mixing liquor;<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Who acquit the criminal as a result of a bribe, / But refuse righteousness to the righteous!<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Therefore as a tongue of fire consumes the stubble, / And the chaff sinks in flames, / Their root will be like decay, / And their bud will disappear like dust; / For they have rejected the instruction of Jehovah of hosts / And despised the speaking of the Holy One of Israel.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> For this reason the anger of Jehovah burns against His people, / And He stretches out His hand over them and strikes them. / And the mountains quake, and their corpses are / Like garbage in the middle of the street. / In spite of all this His anger is not turned away; / Rather, His hand is still stretched out.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> He also lifts up a standard to a distant nation, / And whistles to it from the ends of the earth; / And indeed it comes with swift speed.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> None <i>of them</i> is weary, and none stumbles among them; / No one slumbers or sleeps; / And their belts are not loosened at their waists, / Nor are their sandal thongs broken.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> The arrows of these are sharpened, / And all their bows are drawn; / The hooves of their horses are considered to be like flint, / And their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> Their roar is like a lion’s, / And they roar like young lions; / When they growl and seize prey, / They carry <i>it</i> away safe, and there is none to rescue <i>it.</i><br>
				 <sup>30</sup> And they will growl over it in that day, / Like the roaring of the sea. / When one will look upon the land, indeed, there will be darkness <i>and</i> distress, / And the light will be darkened with its clouds.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Seraphim hovered over Him, each having six wings: With two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And one called to the other, saying:Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; / The whole earth is filled with His glory.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Then I said,Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell; / Yet my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Then one of the seraphim flew to me with an ember in his hand, <i>which</i> he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And he touched my mouth <i>with it</i> and said,Now that this has touched your lips, / Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us? And I said, Here am I; send me.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> And He said, Go and say to this people,Hear indeed, but do not perceive; / And see indeed, but do not understand.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Make the heart of this people numb; / Dull their ears, / And seal their eyes; / Lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, / And their heart perceive and return, and they are healed.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And I said, For how long, Lord? And He said, / Until cities lie devastated, / Without inhabitants, / And houses are without people, / And the land is devastated <i>and</i> a waste;<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And Jehovah has sent men far away <i>from it,</i> / And desolate places abound in the midst of the land.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> But there will still be a tenth part in it; / And it in turn is to be burned / Like a terebinth or an oak, / Whose stump remains after its felling; / Its stump will be a holy seed.<br>

			<h4 id="isaiah-7">7</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, the king of Judah, Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to <i>wage</i> war against it, but they were not able to prevail against it.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And it was reported to the house of David that Aram allied with Ephraim, and his heart and the heart of his people quivered as the trees of the forest quiver in the face of a wind.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to the Fuller’s Field;<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And say to him, Be careful and be quiet; do not fear, and do not be fainthearted because of these two smoking firebrand stubs, at the burning anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Because Aram <i>and</i> Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have planned evil against you, saying,<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Let us go up against Judah and make it sick with terror and break it open for ourselves, and let us set the son of Tabel in its midst as king;<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, / It shall not stand, and it shall not happen;<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> For the head of Aram is Damascus, / And the head of Damascus is Rezin; / And in another sixty-five years / Ephraim will be shattered as a people.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, / And the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah; / If you do not believe, surely you will not remain standing.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Then Jehovah spoke further to Ahaz, saying,<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Ask for a sign from Jehovah your God; make <i>it</i> as deep as Sheol, or make <i>it</i> as high as high can go.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not try Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And he said, Hear now, O house of David, is it too small a thing for you to exhaust the patience of men that you will exhaust the patience of my God as well?<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> He will eat curds and honey until he knows how to refuse evil and choose good.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> For before this boy knows how to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Jehovah will bring upon you and your people and the house of your father such days as have not been since the days when Ephraim turned away from Judah; <i>He will</i> <i>bring</i> <i>upon you</i> the king of Assyria.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And in that day Jehovah will whistle for the flies which are at the ends of the rivers of Egypt and for the bees which are in the land of Assyria.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines and the clefts of the cliffs and on all the thornbushes and on all watering places.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> In that day the Lord will shave with the razor hired from beyond the River, with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the legs; and it will take away the beard as well.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> And in that day each man will keep alive <i>only</i> a milk cow and two females of the flock.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> And because of the abundance of milk produced, he will eat curds; for everyone left behind in the midst of the land will eat curds and honey.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> And in that day every place where there could be a thousand vines, <i>worth</i> a thousand shekels of silver, will become thorns and thistles.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> <i>Men</i> will come there with arrows and bow, for all the land will be thorns and thistles.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> And to all the hills that once were hoed with the hoe you will not go for fear of thorns and thistles; but they will become a place for cattle to roam in and for sheep to trample.<br>
			</p>

		<div class="desc">
			<h4 id="isaiah-8">8</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah said to me, Take a large tablet and write on it in plain letters, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz;<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And I will take faithful witnesses, Urijah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. And Jehovah said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz,<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> For before this boy knows how to call, Father, and, Mother, they will carry off the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Then Jehovah spoke further to me, saying,<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Because these people have rejected / The gently flowing waters of Shiloah, and exult / In Rezin and the son of Remaliah,<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Now therefore the Lord is bringing up upon them / The mighty and abundant waters of the Euphrates, / The king of Assyria and all his glory; / And it will overflow all its channels, / And go over all its banks.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> It will sweep through Judah; it will overflow and rise / Until it reaches the neck; / And the spreading out of its wings / Will fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Be broken, O peoples, and be shattered; / Hearken, all you distant places of the earth: / Gird yourselves, yet be shattered; / Gird yourselves, yet be shattered.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Take counsel, yet it will be frustrated; / Speak the word, yet it will not stand; / For God is with us.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> For Jehovah spoke to me in this way with great force and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> You shall not call <i>it</i> conspiracy / All that this people calls conspiracy; / And you shall not fear what they fear nor hold <i>it</i> in awe.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> You shall sanctify Jehovah of hosts; / He shall be the One to fear and He shall be the One to hold in awe.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Then He will become a sanctuary, yet a stone to strike against / And a rock of stumbling / To both houses of Israel, / A trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> And many will stumble at these, / And will fall and be broken to pieces, / And will be snared and taken captive.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Bind up the testimony; seal the instruction among my disciples;<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> And I will wait on Jehovah, who hides His face from the house of Jacob, and I will look eagerly for Him.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> See, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who abides on Mount Zion.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> When they say to you, Inquire of the necromancers and the familiar spirits, who twitter and mutter; <i>say to them,</i> Should not a people inquire of their God? <i>Should they go</i> to the dead on behalf of the living —<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because in them there is no dawn.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> And they go through it hard-pressed and hungry; and when they are hungry, they rage and curse their king and their God. They turn their faces upward,<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> And they look to the earth, but there is <i>only</i> distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish and being thrust into darkness.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> But gloom <i>does</i> not <i>remain in the place</i> where there was anguish: formerly He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali contemptibly, but afterward He treats the way of the sea, across the Jordan, with glory, Galilee of the nations.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> The people who walked in the darkness / Have seen a great light; / Upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death / Light has shined.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> You have multiplied the nation; / You have increased their gladness; / They are glad before You as with the gladness of harvest, / As <i>men</i> rejoice when they divide the spoil.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> For You break the yoke of their burden / And the staff on their shoulder, / The rod of their oppressor, / As in the day of Midian.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> For all the boots / Of those who in boots trample in the battle-quake / And the garments / Rolled in blood / Are for burning; / <i>They are</i> fuel for fire.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> For a child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> To the increase of <i>His</i> government / And to <i>His</i> peace there is no end, / Upon the throne of David / And over His kingdom, / To establish it / And to uphold it / In justice and righteousness / From now to eternity. / The zeal of Jehovah of hosts / Will accomplish this.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> The Lord sends out a word against Jacob, / And it descends upon Israel.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> And all the people know <i>it,</i> / Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, / Saying in pride and haughtiness of heart,<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> The bricks have fallen, but we will build with cut stone; / The sycamores have been felled, but we will put cedars in their place.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Then Jehovah exalts the adversaries of Rezin against them / And goads their enemies on.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west: / They devour Israel with an open mouth. / By all this His anger is not turned; / His hand is still outstretched.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Yet the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, / Nor do they seek Jehovah of hosts.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Then Jehovah cuts off from Israel head and tail, / Palm branch and marsh reed in one day.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> The elder and the highly regarded — he is the head; / The prophet <i>and</i> the teacher of falsehood — he is the tail.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And those who lead this people are those who mislead <i>them;</i> / And those who are led are those who are confused.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Because of this the Lord will not rejoice in their young men, / And He will not have compassion on their orphans and widows; / For all of them are profane and evildoers, / And every mouth speaks foolishness. / By all this His anger is not turned; / His hand is still outstretched.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> For wickedness burns like a fire; / It devours thorn and thistle, / And burns in the forest thickets; / And they roll up <i>into</i> a column of smoke.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> At the overflowing wrath of Jehovah of hosts a land is burned up, / And the people are like fuel for fire; / No one spares <i>even</i> his brother.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> One carves on the right side, but is hungry; / And <i>another</i> eats on the left side, but is not satisfied. / Each eats the flesh of his own arm:<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to those who decree decrees of iniquity, / To the busy writers who are busy writing trouble,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> In order to turn the poor away from judgment, / And to tear justice away from the afflicted among my people; / That widows may be their spoil, / And they may plunder orphans.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And what will you do for the day of visitation, / And for the devastation that comes from afar? / To whom will you flee for help? / And where will you leave your glory,<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Unless one crouches behind prisoners, / And they fall behind the slain? / By all this His anger is not turned; / His hand is still outstretched.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! / The staff which is in their hand is My indignation.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Against a profane nation I send them out, / And against the people of My overflowing wrath I command them, / To make spoil of the spoil and to make plunder of the plunder, / To make them a trampling ground, like street mire.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> But they do not think so, / And their heart does not conceive it so; / For destroying is in their heart, / And the cutting down of no few nations.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> For they say, / Are not my princes all kings?<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Is not Calno like Carchemish, / Or Hamath like Arpad, / Or Samaria like Damascus?<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Since my hand has reached / The kingdoms of the idols, / And their graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Shall I not do, as I have done / To Samaria and its idols, / The same to Jerusalem and its images?<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> But when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, <i>He says,</i> I will punish the fruit of the king of Assyria’s haughtiness of heart and the glory of his haughty eyes.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> For he has said, / By the strength of my own hand I have done <i>it,</i> / And by my own wisdom; for I have understanding. / And I have removed the boundaries of the peoples; / And their stored possessions I have plundered. / And like a bull, I brought down those who sit <i>on thrones.</i><br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And my hand reached in, like in a nest, / For the wealth of the peoples; / And like one who gathers abandoned eggs, / I myself gathered in all the earth; / And none fluttered a wing, / Or opened a beak and chirped.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Should the ax glorify itself above him who chops with it? / Or should the saw magnify itself above him who wields it? / <i>It would be</i> like the rod wielding him who lifts it up, / Like the staff lifting up him who is not wood.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Therefore the Lord Jehovah of hosts will send / Leanness to his fat ones; / And under his glory He will kindle a kindling, / Like the kindling of fire.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> And the Light of Israel will become a fire, / And his Holy One a flame; / And it will burn and devour his thorns / And his thistles in one day.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> The glory of his forest and of his garden land / He will destroy, both soul and body; / And he will be like a sick man wasting away.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And what is left of the trees of his forest will be so few in number / That a young boy could record them.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Then in that day the remnant of Israel and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped will no longer rely upon him who strikes them, but they will rely upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> For though your people, O Israel, are like the sand of the sea, <i>only</i> a remnant among them will return. Annihilation is strictly decided, overflowing with righteousness.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> For utter destruction and a strict decision is the Lord Jehovah of hosts performing in the midst of the whole land.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah of hosts, O My people dwelling in Zion, do not fear Assyria, who strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you the way Egypt <i>did.</i><br>
				 <sup>25</sup> For in a very little while <i>My</i> indignation will be completed, and My anger <i>will be turned</i> toward their destruction.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> And against them Jehovah of hosts will rouse up a whip like the stroke against Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea, and He will lift it up the way <i>He did in</i> Egypt.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> And in that day their burden will be removed from your shoulders, and their yoke from off your neck; and the yoke will be broken due to the fatness.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> He comes against Aiath; / He passes through Migron; / At Michmash he deposits his gear.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> They go through the pass, <i>saying,</i> / Geba will be our lodging overnight. / Ramah is quaking; / Gibeah of Saul flees away.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> Scream with your voice, O daughter of Gallim! / Listen carefully, Laishah! O poor Anathoth!<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> Madmenah flees; / The inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge.<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> <i>So it is</i> this very day when he halts at Nob. / He swings his hand over the mountain of the daughter of Zion, / Over the hill of Jerusalem.<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> But now the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Is lopping off the boughs with an awful crash: / Those which are tall in height are hewn down, / And those which are lofty are laid low.<br>
				 <sup>34</sup> And He chops away the forest thickets with an iron ax; / And Lebanon falls at <i>the hands</i> of a majestic One.<br>

				 <sup>12</sup> He will lift up a standard to the nations, / And will gather the outcasts of Israel; / And the dispersed of Judah He will assemble / From the four corners of the earth.<br>

				 <sup>11</sup> On the day that you plant <i>them</i> you fence <i>them</i> in carefully, / And in the morning you bring your seed to blossom; / <i>But</i> the harvest is a heap on a day of sickness / And incurable pain.<br>

				 <sup>16</sup> In that day the Egyptians will be like women, and they will tremble and be in dread before the waving of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which He will be waving over them.<br>

				 <sup>18</sup> In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will be speaking the language of Canaan and swearing to Jehovah of hosts; one will be called the City of Destruction.<br>

				 <sup>19</sup> And I will drive you from your position, / And from your standing He will pull you down.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> And in that day / I will call to My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,<br>

				 <sup>11</sup> When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off; / Women come <i>and</i> make a fire with them; / For they are not a people of understanding. / Therefore He who made them will not have compassion on them, / And He who formed them will not show favor to them.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And in that day Jehovah will beat out <i>the</i> <i>grain</i> from the flowing stream of the River / Unto the brook of Egypt; / And you will be gleaned / One by one, O you children of Israel.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, / And the ones lost in the land of Assyria will come, / As well as the outcasts in the land of Egypt, / And they will worship Jehovah / On the holy mountain in Jerusalem.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim / And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, / Which is at the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome by wine.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Indeed the Lord has someone strong and mighty; / As a hailstorm <i>and</i> a tempest of destruction, / As a storm of mighty overflowing waters, / He will cast down to the earth with <i>His</i> hand.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim / Will be trodden under foot;<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, / Which is at the head of the fat valley, / Will be like the first-ripe <i>fig</i> before the summer, / Which when someone looks upon it he sees it, / <i>And</i> in an instant it is in his hand, and he swallows it up.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> In that day Jehovah of hosts / Will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of His people,<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment / And strength to those who turn away the battle at the gate.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> But these also reel with wine / And stagger from liquor: / The priest and the prophet reel from liquor; / They are swallowed up with wine; / They stagger from liquor, / They reel in <i>their</i> visions, / They totter in <i>their</i> judgments.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> For all the tables are full of vomit <i>and</i> filth; / There is no place <i>clean.</i><br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Whom will he teach knowledge? / And whom will he instruct with the report? / Those weaned from milk? / Those drawn from the breasts?<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> For <i>his words are:</i> Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; / Line upon line, line upon line; / Here a little, there a little.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> For with stammering lips / And with a foreign tongue / He will speak to this people,<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> He who said to them, / This is rest; give rest to the weary; / And, This is repose. / But they would not hear.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Therefore Jehovah’s word to them will be: / Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; / Line upon line, line upon line; / Here a little, there a little; / That they may go and stumble backward, / And be broken, snared, and taken.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, / You scoffing men, / Who rule this people / Who are in Jerusalem:<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Because you have said, We have made / A covenant with death, / And with Sheol / We have made an agreement: / When the overflowing scourge passes through, / It will not come upon us; / For we have made falsehood our refuge / And have hidden ourselves in deception.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Therefore thus says / The Lord Jehovah: / Indeed I lay a stone in Zion as a foundation, / A tested stone, / A precious cornerstone <i>as a</i> foundation firmly established; / He who believes will not hasten away.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> And I will make justice the line / And righteousness the plummet; / And the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, / And the waters will overflow the secret place.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And your covenant with death will be annulled, / And your agreement with Sheol will not stand; / When the overflowing scourge passes through, / You will be a trampling ground to it.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> As often as it passes through, / It will take hold of you. / For morning by morning it will pass through, / By day and by night; / And it will be nothing but terror / To understand the report <i>of it.</i><br>
				 <sup>20</sup> For the bed is too short for a man to stretch on, / And the sheet is too narrow for him to wrap himself in.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> For Jehovah will rise as on Mount Perazim, / He will be agitated as in the valley of Gibeon, / To do His deed, His strange deed, / And to do His work, His most different work.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Now therefore do not be mockers, / Lest your fetters become stronger; / For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Of complete and decisive destruction upon the whole earth.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Hearken and hear my voice; / Attend and hear my speech.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Does the plowman plow all day long to sow his seed? / Does he open and harrow his ground <i>continually?</i><br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Does he not, once he levels the surface, / Scatter dill and broadcast cummin, / And put the wheat in rows and the barley in <i>its</i> appointed place / And the rye where it belongs?<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> For his God instructs him toward <i>such</i> discretion / And teaches him <i>so.</i><br>
				 <sup>27</sup> For dill is not threshed with a sharp tool, / Nor is the cart wheel turned upon the cummin; / But dill is beaten out with a rod, / And cummin with a stick.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> Bread grains are ground, / Yet one does not thresh and thresh forever. / And once the wheel of his cart and his horses drive over <i>it,</i> / One does not grind it.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> This also comes forth from Jehovah of hosts, / He who makes <i>His</i> counsel extraordinary and <i>His</i> sound wisdom great.<br>

				 <sup>4</sup> And you will be brought down; from the ground you will speak, / And your speech will <i>come</i> from low in the dust. / And your voice will be like that of a departed spirit from the ground, / And your speech will twitter from the dust.<br>

				 <sup>6</sup> From Jehovah of hosts you will be visited, / With thunder and earthquake and great noise, / With whirlwind and tempest and the flame of consuming fire.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, / Even all who fight against her and her stronghold and who distress her, / Will be like a dream, <i>like</i> a vision in the night.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And as when a hungry man dreams and <i>finds himself</i> eating, / But he awakens and what he desires is not there; / Or as when a thirsty man dreams and <i>finds himself</i> drinking, / But he awakens and is indeed faint and what he desires is far from him; / So will the multitude of all the nations be / That fight against Mount Zion.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Linger and be astounded, / Blind yourselves and be blind. / They are drunk, but not with wine; / They stagger, but not with liquor.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> For Jehovah has poured out upon you / A spirit of deep sleep / And has shut your eyes, the prophets; / And your heads, the seers, He has covered.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And all the vision will be to you like the words of a book that has been sealed, which when they give to him who is literate, saying, Please read this, he will say, I am not able to, for it is sealed.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Then the book will be given to him who is illiterate, saying, Please read this, and he will say, I am illiterate.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> And the Lord said, / Because this people draws near with their mouth, / And with their lips they honor Me, / Yet they remove their heart far from Me, / And their fear for Me / Is a commandment of men <i>merely</i> learned;<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Therefore, indeed, I will once again / Do something wondrous with this people, something wondrously marvelous; / And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, / And the understanding of those who understand will be hidden.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Woe to those who hide deeply / Their counsel from Jehovah, / And whose deeds are in the dark / And who say, Who sees us? And, Who knows us?<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> You turn things upside down! / Shall the potter be considered to be like the clay, / That what is made should say of him who made it, He did not make me, / Or what is formed should say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Is it not yet a little while / Before Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, / And the fruitful field will be considered to be a forest.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And in that day the deaf will hear the words of the book, / And out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see,<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And the afflicted will increase their joy in Jehovah, / And the needy of mankind will exult in the Holy One of Israel.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> For he who terrorizes will cease to be, and the scorner will be consumed, / And all who watch for iniquity will be cut off,<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Those who make a man sin by his words / And ensnare him who judges at the gate / And turn aside the righteous with an empty argument.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Therefore thus says Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob,Jacob will not now be ashamed, / Nor will his face now turn pale;<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, / They will sanctify My name / And sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, / And hold the God of Israel in awe.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> And those who have erred in spirit will come to understand, / And the murmurers will learn teaching.<br>

				 <sup>3</sup> Therefore the refuge of Pharaoh will be your shame, / And shelter in the shadow of Egypt, <i>your</i> humiliation.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> For their princes are at Zoan, / And their ambassadors have come to Hanes.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> All are ashamed / Of a people that cannot profit them, / Nor be a help or profit <i>to them,</i> / But rather a shame and also a reproach.<br>

				 <sup>7</sup> For Egypt helps in a vain and empty way. / Therefore I call her / Rahab, who sits still.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Go now; write it on a tablet before them, / And inscribe it on a scroll, / That it may be, for the time to come, / As a witness forever.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> For this is a rebellious people, / False children, / Children who refuse to hear / The instruction of Jehovah;<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Who say to those who see, Do not see; / And to those who have visions, Do not give us true visions; / Speak pleasant things to us; / Give <i>us</i> illusions as your visions;<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Get out of the way; / Turn aside from the path; / Cause the Holy One of Israel / To cease from before us.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, / Because you despise this word / And trust in oppression and guile, / And rely on them,<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Therefore this iniquity / Will be to you / Like a breach ready to fall, / Sticking out on a high wall, / Whose crashing comes / In an instant, suddenly.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And its crashing will be like the crashing of the potters’ vessel: / Crushed — he will not spare; / And there will not be found / Among the crushed pieces a shard / <i>With which</i> to take fire from the hearth / Or to draw water from the cistern.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, / In returning and rest you will be saved; / In quietness and in trust will be your strength; / But you were not willing,<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And said, No, for we will flee on horses; / Therefore you will flee. / And, We will ride upon the swift; / Therefore those who chase you will be swift.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> One thousand <i>will</i> <i>flee</i> at the rebuke of one; / At the rebuke of five you will flee, / Until you are left / Like a <i>bare</i> mast upon a mountaintop / And a standard on a hill.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And therefore Jehovah waits to be gracious to you, / And therefore He remains on high to have compassion on you; / For Jehovah is a God of justice; / Blessed are all those who wait for Him.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> For a people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem — / You will weep no more; / He will be most gracious to you at the sound of your cry; / When He hears it, He will answer you.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> And though the Lord has given you / The bread of adversity and the water of oppression, / Your Teacher will no longer hide Himself in a corner, / But your eyes will see your Teacher.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, / This is the way, walk in it, / When you turn to the right or turn to the left.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> And you will defile the silver covering of your graven images / And the gold plating of your molten idols; / You will scatter them like some dirty thing; / You will say to it, Go away!<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Then He will give rain for your seed, / Which you will sow in the ground, / And the bread of the increase of the ground; / And it will be fat and plenteous. / Your livestock will feed in that day / In a vast pasture.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> And the oxen and donkeys that work the ground / Will eat salted fodder that has been winnowed with shovel and fork.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> And upon every high mountain / And upon every prominent hill / There will be brooks <i>and</i> streams of water / In the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, / On the day when Jehovah binds up the breach of His people / And heals the wound <i>left</i> from His stroke.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Behold, the name of Jehovah comes from a distance, / Burning with His anger and heavy with smoke; / His lips are full of indignation, / And His tongue is like a devouring fire;<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> His breath, like an overflowing stream, / Reaches up to the neck, / To sift the nations with the sieve of nothingness; / And a bridle that leads them to err is in the jaws of the peoples.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> You will have a song / As in the night when the feast is sanctified, / And gladness of heart as when one marches to the flute / To go to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> And Jehovah will cause the majesty of His voice to be heard / And the descending of His arm to be seen, / With the blasting of anger and the flame of devouring fire, / In cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones.<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> For at the voice of Jehovah, Assyria will be dismayed; / With a staff He will strike.<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> And every pass of the appointed rod, / Which Jehovah will lay upon him, / Will be with tambourines and harps; / And in battles of brandishing weapons He will fight against them.<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> For Topheth has been arranged since long ago; / Indeed it has been prepared for the king; / He made <i>it</i> deep; He made <i>it</i> large. / The pile in it is of fire and much wood; / The breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, / Sets it on fire.<br>

				 <sup>6</sup> Then the lame will leap like a hart, / And the tongue of the dumb will give a ringing shout; / For water will break forth in the wilderness, / And streams in the desert.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And the desert mirage will become a pool, / And the thirsty ground, springs of water; / In the habitation of jackals, their resting place, / There will be grass with reeds and rushes.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And a highway will be there, and a way, / And it will be called, The Way of Holiness. / The unclean will not pass on it, / But it will be for him who walks on the way; / No fools will err <i>in it.</i><br>
				 <sup>9</sup> There will be no lion there, / Nor will any ravenous animal go up on it; / They will not be found there; / But the redeemed will walk <i>on it.</i><br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And the ransomed of Jehovah will return / And will come to Zion with a ringing shout, / And eternal joy will be upon their heads. / They will lay hold on gladness and joy, / And sorrow and sighing will flee away.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib the king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And the king of Assyria sent the Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a great force. And he stood at the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to the Fuller’s Field.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And the Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What is this confidence in which you trust?<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> I say, <i>It is</i> but a vain word <i>that you say,</i> There is counsel and strength for war. Now in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> You now have put <i>your</i> trust in the staff of this broken reed, in Egypt, which, if a man should lean on <i>it,</i> will go into his hand and pierce it, for so is Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship <i>only</i> before this altar?<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Now therefore give pledges to my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if <i>indeed</i> you are able to set riders on them.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> How then can you refuse one official of the least of my master’s servants and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And have I now come up apart from Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh, Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, because we understand <i>it;</i> and do not speak to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people upon the wall.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> But the Rab-shakeh said, Has my master sent me <i>only</i> to your master and to you to speak these words, <i>and</i> not to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Then the Rab-shakeh stood and cried out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria:<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Thus says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, because he is not able to deliver you;<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Neither let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me, and let each eat from his own vine and each from his own fig tree, and let each drink the waters of his own cistern;<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Until I come and take you away to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> <i>Be careful</i> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> But they were silent and did not answer him a word, because of the commandment of the king that said, You shall not answer him.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of the Rab-shakeh.<br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="desc">
			<h4 id="isaiah-37">37</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> And when King Hezekiah heard, he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, who had covered themselves in sackcloth, to Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of affliction, rebuke, and contempt, for children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring <i>them</i> forth.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> It may be that Jehovah your God will hear the words of the Rab-shakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which Jehovah your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant which is left.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And Isaiah said to them, Thus you shall say to your master, Thus says Jehovah, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Indeed I will put a spirit in him, so that he will hear a report and return to his land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And the Rab-shakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, because he had heard that <i>the king</i> had departed from Lachish.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> And he heard <i>a report</i> about Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia which said, He has come forth to make war with you. And when he heard <i>it,</i> he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> In this way you shall speak to Hezekiah the king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Indeed you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them utterly. And will you be delivered?<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Have the gods of the nations, whom my fathers destroyed, delivered them: Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden, who were in Telassar?<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Where are the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah?<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah and spread it before Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, You who are enthroned <i>between</i> the cherubim, You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth; You made the heavens and the earth.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Incline Your ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open Your eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent <i>messengers</i> to reproach the living God.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries and their land,<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And have cast their gods into the fire, because they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; so they destroyed them.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> And now, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent <i>a message</i> to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib the king of Assyria,<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> This is the word which Jehovah has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion / Has despised you <i>and</i> laughed at you; / The daughter of Jerusalem / Has shaken <i>her</i> head behind you.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Whom have you reproached and reviled? / Against whom have you lifted up <i>your</i> voice / And lifted up your eyes haughtily? / Against the Holy One of Israel.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> By your servants you have reproached the Lord, / And you have said, In the multitude of my chariots, / I have come up to the heights of the mountains, / To the sides of Lebanon. / And I will cut down its tall cedars, / <i>And</i> the choicest of its cypresses: / I will enter into its farthest height / <i>And</i> its luxuriant forest.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> I have dug; / I have drunk water; / With the sole of my foot I have dried up / All the rivers of Egypt.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> Have you not heard / <i>That</i> long ago I did it; / And from the days of old I had formed it? / Now I have brought it to pass, / That <i>you</i> should destroy fortified cities, / <i>And make them into</i> ruinous heaps.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength; / They were dismayed and felt ashamed; / And they were <i>like</i> vegetation of the field / And green shoots of tender grass, / <i>Like</i> grass <i>which grows</i> on the housetops / And is scorched before it has grown up.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> But I know your sitting down, / And your going out and your coming in, / And your raging against Me.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> Because your raging against Me / And your arrogance has come up into My ears, / I will put My hook in your nose / And My bridle in your lips, / And turn you back on the way by which you came.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> This shall be the sign to you: This year you shall eat that which grows up of itself, and the second year that which shoots up from the same, and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> And the remnant of those who have escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> For a remnant will go forth out of Jerusalem, and from Mount Zion those who have escaped. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> Therefore, thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria,He shall not come to this city, / Nor shoot an arrow there; / Neither shall he come against it with shields, / And build up a mound against it.<br>
				 <sup>34</sup> By the way on which he came, / By the same shall he return, / And into this city he shall not come, / Declares Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>35</sup> And around this city I will put an enclosure / To save it, / For My own sake / And for the sake of David, My servant.<br>
				 <sup>36</sup> Then the angel of Jehovah went out and struck the Assyrians’ camp, a hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when they arose early in the morning, all of them were corpses, dead.<br>
				 <sup>37</sup> Then Sennacherib the king of Assyria departed and went back to dwell in Nineveh.<br>
				 <sup>38</sup> And when he was worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons slew him with the sword; and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.<br>

			<h4 id="isaiah-38">38</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill; and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Put your house in order, for you are about to die and will not live.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Jehovah,<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And said, Now, O Jehovah, please remember how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in Your sight. And Hezekiah wept many tears.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying,<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Go and speak to Hezekiah, Thus says Jehovah, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; I will now add to your life fifteen years.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will put an enclosure around this city.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And this will be the sign from Jehovah to you, that Jehovah will do this thing which He has spoken.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which has gone down with the sun on the steps of Ahaz, to go back ten steps. So the sun’s <i>shadow</i> went back ten steps on the steps on which it had gone down.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> The writing of Hezekiah the king of Judah when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> I said, In the middle of my days, / I will go into the gates of Sheol; / I have been deprived of the rest of my years.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> I said, I will not see Jah, / Jah in the land of the living; / I will not look on man any longer, / <i>While I am</i> with those who dwell where everything has ceased.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Like a shepherd’s tent, / My dwelling has been pulled up and removed from me. / Like a weaver, I have rolled up my life. / He will cut me off from the loom; / From day until night You make an end of me.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> I have stilled myself until the morning; / Like a lion, so He breaks all my bones; / From day until night You make an end of me.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Like a swallow <i>and</i> a crane, so I twitter; / Like a dove, I mourn; / My eyes look languishingly above; / O Lord, I am oppressed; be my surety.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> What shall I say? He has both spoken to me, / And He Himself has done it; / I will walk deliberately all my years, / Because of the bitterness of my soul.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> O Lord, upon these things <i>men</i> live; / And in all of these things is the life of my spirit; / Therefore may You restore my strength / And make me live.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Indeed for peace I had bitterness, yes, bitterness; / But You have lovingly delivered my soul from the pit of destruction, / Because You have cast behind Your back / All my sins.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> For Sheol cannot thank You, / And Death cannot praise You; / They that go down to the pit / Cannot hope in Your truth.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> The living, the living, he will praise You, / As I do today; / A father shall make known / Your truth to <i>his</i> children.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Jehovah <i>is ready</i> to save me; / Therefore we will sing my songs, / With stringed instruments, / All the days of our life, / In the house of Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Then Isaiah said, Let them take a cake of figs and rub it upon the boil, and he will live.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Hezekiah had also said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, the king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> And Hezekiah was glad for them and showed them his treasury, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the fine oil, and his whole armory and everything which was found among his treasures; there was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, What did these men say? And from where have they come to you? And Hezekiah said, They have come to me from a distant land, from Babylon.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah said, They have seen everything that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> The days are now coming when everything that is in your house and that your fathers have laid up as a treasure unto this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left, says Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And they will take away some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.<br>

				 <sup>4</sup> Every valley will be lifted up, / And every mountain and hill will be made low, / And the crooked places will become straight, / And the rough places, a broad plain.<br>

				 <sup>12</sup> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, / Who has calculated <i>the extent of</i> the heavens with a handspan, / And measured out the dust of the earth by a measure, / And weighed the mountains in scales / And the hills in balances?<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Who has directed the Spirit of Jehovah, / Or who has made <i>matters</i> known to Him as His counselor?<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> With whom did He consult and who instructed Him, / And taught Him in the path of justice, / And taught Him knowledge, / And caused Him to know the way of understanding?<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Indeed the nations are like a drop from a bucket, / And are accounted as specks of dust on the scales. / Indeed He takes up the islands as very fine powder.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, / Nor are its beasts sufficient for a burnt offering.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> All the nations are as nothing before Him; / They are counted by Him as less than nothing and vanity.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> To whom then will you liken God? / Or what likeness will you compare to Him?<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> When the workman has cast an idol, / A goldsmith overlays it with gold / Also refining chains of silver <i>for it.</i><br>
				 <sup>20</sup> He that is <i>so</i> impoverished <i>that he lacks</i> an offering / Chooses wood that will not rot, / And seeks a skillful craftsman for himself / To prepare an idol that will not be moved.<br>

				 <sup>5</sup> The coastlands saw it and were afraid; / The ends of the earth trembled; / They drew near and came.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Each one helps his neighbor, / And <i>each one</i> says to his brother, Be strong.<br>

				 <sup>16</sup> You shall winnow them, and the wind will carry them away / And the storm wind will scatter them. / And you will rejoice in Jehovah, / You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> When the poor and needy seek for water, and there is none, / And their tongue is dry from thirst, / I, Jehovah, will answer them; / <i>As</i> the God of Israel I will not forsake them.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> I will open up rivers on the bare heights, / And in the midst of the valleys, springs. / I will make the wilderness into a pool of water, / And the dry land into springs of water.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, / The acacia, the myrtle, and the olive tree; / I will place in the desert the fir tree, / The pine tree, and the box tree together;<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> That they may see and know, / And consider and understand together, / That the hand of Jehovah has done this, / And the Holy One of Israel has created it.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Present your case, says Jehovah; / Bring forward your arguments, says the King of Jacob.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Let them bring forth and declare to us / What will take place; / Let them show what the former things were, / That we may consider <i>them,</i> / And may know the end of them; / Or let us hear the things that are coming.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Declare <i>to us</i> the things that are coming afterward, / That we may know that you are gods; / Indeed do good or do evil, / That we may look at one another anxiously and be afraid together.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> You are indeed nothing, / And your work is of no consequence; / He who chooses you is an abomination.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> I have raised up one from the north and he has come; / From the rising of the sun he will call upon My name. / He will come upon rulers as <i>upon</i> mortar, / As the potter treads the clay.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> Who has declared <i>it</i> from the beginning that we may know, / And in advance that we may say, <i>He is</i> right? / Indeed there was no one who declared <i>it;</i> indeed no one who let <i>us</i> hear; / Indeed no one who heard your words.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Formerly <i>I said</i> to Zion, Here, here they are; / And to Jerusalem, I will give someone who preaches glad tidings.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> But I looked and there was no man, / And from among these there was no counselor, / Who, when I asked, would give <i>Me</i> an answer.<br>

				 <sup>9</sup> Indeed, the former things have come to pass, / And new things I am telling <i>you;</i> / Before they spring forth / I will let you hear <i>them.</i><br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Sing a new song to Jehovah; / <i>Sing</i> His praise from the end of the earth; / You who go down to the sea and <i>all</i> that fills it, / You coastlands and their inhabitants.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Let the wilderness and its cities, / The villages which Kedar inhabits, lift up <i>their voices;</i> / Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy; / Let them shout from the tops of the mountains.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Let them give glory to Jehovah, / And declare His praise in the coastlands.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man, / Like a man of war He will stir up <i>His</i> jealousy; / He will raise a war cry; He will even roar. / He will prevail over His enemies.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> For a long time I have been silent; / I have kept still, I have restrained Myself. / <i>Now</i> I will cry like a woman in travail; / I will gasp and pant at the same time.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> I will lay waste the mountains and hills, / And all of their vegetation I will dry up; / And I will make the rivers into islands; / I will dry up the pools.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> I will bring the blind on a way they do not know; / I will guide them in paths they do not know; / I will make the darkness into light before them, / And crooked things straight. / These are the things / I will do for them and will not forsake them.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> They who have turned back will be utterly put to shame, / <i>That is,</i> those who trust in graven images, / Those who say to molten images, / You are our gods.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> You who are deaf, Hear; / And you who are blind, Look, that you may see.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Who is blind except My servant, / And as deaf as My messenger, <i>whom</i> I will send? / Who is as blind as the one at peace <i>with Me,</i> / And as blind as the servant of Jehovah?<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> You have seen many things and do not observe <i>them;</i> / <i>His</i> ears are open, but he does not hear.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Jehovah is well pleased for His righteousness’ sake; / He will magnify the law and make <i>it</i> honorable.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> But this is a people plundered and spoiled: / All of them are trapped in holes, / And they are hidden in prison houses; / They have become plunder, and there is no one to deliver; / <i>They have become</i> spoil, and there is no one to say, Restore <i>them.</i><br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Who among you will give ear to this? / <i>Who will</i> pay attention and listen to the coming things?<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Who gave Jacob to the plunderers, / And Israel to the robbers? / Was it not Jehovah, against whom we have sinned, / And in whose ways they were not willing to walk, / And whose law they would not obey?<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Therefore He poured out upon them the heat of His anger / And the strength of battle; / And it set them on fire round about, yet they did not realize <i>it;</i> / And it burned against them, and they did not take <i>it</i> to heart.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> But now thus says Jehovah / Who created you, O Jacob, and who formed you, O Israel: / Do not fear, because I have redeemed you; / I have called <i>you</i> by your name; you are Mine.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, / And through the rivers, they will not flow over you. / And when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned, / And the flame will not consume you.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Because I am Jehovah your God, / The Holy One of Israel, your Savior, / I have given Egypt as your ransom, / Cush and Seba instead of you.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Since you were precious in My eyes, / <i>Since</i> you have been honorable and I have loved you, / I will give up men in your place, / And peoples in exchange for your life.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Do not fear, because I am with you; / I will bring your seed from the east, / And gather you from the west.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> I will say to the north, Give <i>them</i> up, / And to the south, Do not keep <i>them</i> back. / Bring My sons from afar, / And My daughters from the end of the earth,<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Everyone who is called by My name, / Whom I have created, formed, and even made for My glory.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Bring out the people who are blind yet have eyes, / And those who are deaf yet have ears.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Let all the nations be gathered together, / And let the peoples assemble. / Who among them can declare this / And relate to us the former things? / Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified, / And let them hear and say, <i>It is</i> true.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> You are My witnesses, declares Jehovah, / And My servant whom I have chosen, / In order that you may know and believe Me / And understand that I am He. / Before Me there was no God formed, / Neither will there be any after Me.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> I, <i>even</i> I, am Jehovah; / And there is no Savior besides Me.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> I have declared, and I have saved, and I have let <i>them</i> hear; / There is no strange <i>god</i> among you. / And you are My witnesses, declares Jehovah, / And I am God.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Indeed, before the day <i>was,</i> I am He, / And there is no one who can deliver from My hand. / I will work and who will reverse it?<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Thus says Jehovah, / Your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, / For your sake I have sent to Babylon, / And I will bring down all of them as fugitives, / Even the Chaldeans, whose rejoicing is in the ships.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> I am Jehovah, your Holy One, / The Creator of Israel, your King.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Thus says Jehovah, / Who has made a way in the sea, / And a path in the mighty waters,<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Who brings forth the chariot and the horse, / The army and the powerful together. / They will lie down, they will not rise; / They are extinct, they are quenched like flax.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Do not call to mind the former things, / Nor consider the things of old.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Indeed, I am doing a new thing; / It will now spring forth; / Do you not know it? / I will even make a way in the wilderness, / Rivers in the desert.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> The animals of the field will honor Me, / The jackals and the ostriches, / Because I have given <i>them</i> water in the wilderness, / Rivers in the desert, / To give a drink to My people, My chosen ones.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> This people I have formed for Myself; / They will show forth My praise.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob, / But you have grown weary of Me, O Israel.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> You have not brought Me a sheep for your burnt offerings, / And you have not honored Me with your sacrifices; / I have not made you serve <i>Me</i> with a meal offering, / Nor wearied you with incense.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> You did not buy calamus for Me with money, / And you did not fill Me with the fat of your sacrifices. / Indeed, you have burdened Me with your sins; / You have wearied Me with your iniquities.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> I, <i>even</i> I, am He who wipes away your transgressions for My own sake, / And I will not remember your sins.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> Put Me in remembrance; let us plead <i>in judgment</i> together: / Declare <i>your case</i> that you may be justified.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> Your first father sinned, / And your mediators transgressed against Me.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> Therefore I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, / And I delivered up Jacob to destruction, / And Israel to reviling.<br>

				 <sup>5</sup> One will say, I am Jehovah’s; / Another will call <i>himself</i> by the name of Jacob; / Another will write <i>with</i> his hand, <i>I am</i> Jehovah’s; / He will name <i>himself</i> with the name Israel.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Thus says Jehovah the King of Israel, / And his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts, / I am the First and I am the Last, / And apart from Me there is no God.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> And who can proclaim as I <i>can?</i> / Then let him declare it and recount it in order for Me, / Since I set forth the people of ancient times. / Let them declare to them both the coming things / And the things which will take place.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Do not tremble and do not be afraid. / Have I not related to you from that time and declared <i>it?</i> / And you are My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me? / Or is there any <i>other</i> Rock? I do not know of <i>any.</i><br>
				 <sup>9</sup> All those who make idols are a waste. / And the things they delight in will not profit <i>them.</i> / And those who are witnesses for them do not see, / And they do not know, that they may be put to shame.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Who has formed a god or cast an idol / That is of no profit?<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Indeed, all those joined to him will be put to shame, / For the craftsmen are only men. / Let all of them be gathered together, let them stand up; / Let them be afraid and be put to shame together.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> The ironsmith sharpens a cutting tool, / And works over the coals, / And forms the idol with hammers, / And he works it with the strength of his arm. / Yet he becomes hungry and has no strength; / If he does not drink water, he faints.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> The carpenter stretches out a line; / He marks it out with a marking tool; / He works it with planes, / And marks it with a compass. / He makes it according to the likeness of a man, / Like the beautiful appearance of man, to dwell in a house.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> <i>Someone prepares</i> to cut down cedars for himself, / Or he takes a cypress or an oak; / He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest; / He plants an ash, and the rain nourishes it.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> It is also <i>something</i> for a man to burn; / He takes <i>one</i> of them and warms himself; / He even kindles a fire and bakes bread. / <i>With the same</i> he also makes a god and worships <i>it;</i> / He makes it into a graven image and bows down before it.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Half of it he burns in a fire; / Over this half he eats flesh, / <i>And</i> he roasts a roast and is satisfied. / He also warms himself and says, Ha! / I am warm, I have seen fire.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> The rest of it he makes into a god, into his idol; / He bows down to it and worships <i>it</i> / And prays to it and says, / Deliver me, for you are my god.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> They do not know, and they do not understand, / For He has covered their eyes so that they cannot see, / And their minds so that they cannot understand.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And no one considers in his heart, / And there is no knowledge or understanding to say, / I have burned half of it in the fire, / And I have even baked bread over its coals; / I have roasted flesh and eaten <i>it.</i> / Then shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? / Shall I fall down before a block of wood?<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> He feeds on ashes; / A deceived heart has led him astray; / And he cannot deliver his soul; / Nor does he say, Is this not a lie in my right hand?<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Remember these things, O Jacob, / And Israel, for you are My servant. / I have formed you; you are My servant; / O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> I have wiped away, like a thick cloud, your transgressions, / And like a cloud, your sins. / Return unto Me, for I have redeemed you.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> Sing for joy, O heavens, for Jehovah has accomplished <i>it.</i> / Shout, O lower parts of the earth; / Break forth with singing, O mountains, / The forest and every tree in it; / For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob / And is glorified in Israel.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Thus says Jehovah who redeemed you / And formed you from the womb, / I am Jehovah who makes all things, / Who alone stretches out the heavens, / Who spread out the earth (Who was with Me?);<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Who frustrates the signs of liars, / And makes fools of the diviners; / Who turns back the wise men, / And makes their knowledge foolish;<br>

				 <sup>2</sup> I will go before you / And make level the rough places; / I will shatter the doors of bronze / And cut through the bars of iron,<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> And give to you the treasures of darkness / And the hidden riches of secret places, / That you may know that I am Jehovah, who calls <i>you</i> by your name, / The God of Israel.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> For the sake of My servant, Jacob, / And Israel, My chosen one, / I have also called you by your name; / I have surnamed you, although you do not know Me.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> I am Jehovah and there is no one else; / Besides Me there is no God; / I girded you, although you do not know Me;<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> That they might know from the rising of the sun and from the west / That there is no one besides Me. / I am Jehovah and there is no one else;<br>

				 <sup>9</sup> Woe to him who strives with the One who formed him — / A potsherd among the earthen potsherds. / Shall the clay say to the One who forms it, What are You making? / And your work <i>say,</i> He has no hands?<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Woe to him who says to <i>his</i> father, What are you begetting? / Or to a woman, What are you bringing forth?<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Thus says Jehovah, / The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him, / Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons, / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> I have made the earth, / And created man upon it; / My own hands stretched out the heavens, / And I commanded all of their host.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> I raised him up in righteousness, / And will make straight all his ways; / He will build My city, / And send away My captives, / Neither for a price nor for a reward, / Says Jehovah of hosts.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Thus says Jehovah, / The wealth of Egypt, and the merchandise of Cush, / And the Sabeans, men of stature, / Will pass to you and will be yours. / They will walk behind you; they will come over in chains / And bow down to you <i>and</i> petition you, <i>saying,</i> / Surely God is with you, and there is no one else; / <i>There is</i> no other God.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Surely You are a God who hides Himself, / O God of Israel, the Savior.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> All of them will be ashamed and even confounded; / Those who make idols go in confusion together.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Israel has been saved by Jehovah / With an eternal salvation; / You will not be ashamed or confounded / Forever and ever.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> For thus says Jehovah, / Who created the heavens — / He is the God / Who formed the earth and made it; / He established it; / He did not create it waste, / <i>But</i> He formed it to be inhabited: / I am Jehovah and there is no one else;<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> I have not spoken in secret, / In a dark place of the earth; / I did not say to the seed of Jacob, / Seek Me in vain. / I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, / Declaring things that are right.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Gather yourselves together and come; / Draw near together, / You who have escaped from the nations. / Those who set up their wooden idol / And pray unto a god who cannot save / Have no knowledge.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Declare and present <i>your case;</i> / Indeed, let them take counsel together. / Who related this long ago; / Who declared <i>it</i> from that time? / Was it not I, Jehovah? / And there is no other God besides Me; / A righteous God and Savior, / And there is no one except Me.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Turn to Me and be saved, / All the ends of the earth, / For I am God and there is no one else.<br>

				 <sup>7</sup> Thus says Jehovah, / The Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, / To the despised One, the One abhorred by the nation, / The One subjected to tyrants, / Kings will see and arise, / And princes will bow down; / Because of Jehovah, who is faithful, / The Holy One of Israel, who has chosen You.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Thus says Jehovah, / In an acceptable time I have answered You, / And in a day of salvation I have helped You; / And I will preserve You and give You for a covenant of the people, / To restore the land, to apportion the desolate inheritances,<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> To say to the prisoners, Come forth, / <i>To say</i> to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves. They will feed along the roads, / And their pasture will be on all the bare heights;<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> They will not hunger or thirst; / Neither the scorching heat nor the sun will strike them; / For He who has compassion on them will lead them / And will guide them beside the springs of water;<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And I will make all My mountains into a road, / And My highways will be raised up.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Indeed, these will come from a distance, / And indeed these <i>will come</i> from the north and the west, / And these from the land of the Sinim.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Give a ringing shout, O heavens, and exult, O earth, / And break forth into shouting, O mountains; / For Jehovah has comforted His people / And will have compassion on His afflicted ones.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> But Zion has said, Jehovah has forsaken me, / And the Lord has forgotten me.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Can a woman forget her nursing child, / That she would not have compassion on the son of her womb? / Even though they may forget, / Yet I will not forget you.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Indeed, I have engraved you upon the palms <i>of My hands;</i> / Your walls are continually before Me.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Your children make haste; / Your destroyers and those who lay you waste / Will go forth from you.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Lift up your eyes and look around; / All of these gather themselves together and come to you. / As I live, declares Jehovah, / You will put all of them on like an ornament / And gird <i>yourself</i> with them like a bride.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> For your waste and desolate <i>places</i> / And your devastated land — / For you will be too constricted now because of its inhabitants, / And those who swallowed you up will be far away.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> The children of whom you were bereaved / Will yet say in your ears, / This place is too constricted for me; / Make room for me that I may dwell <i>here.</i><br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Then you will say in your heart, / Who has borne these for me, / Since I have been bereaved <i>of children</i> and am barren, / An exile and driven about? / And who brought these up? / Indeed, I was left alone; / From where did these <i>come?</i><br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, / Indeed, I will lift up My hand to the nations, / And unto the peoples I will lift up My banner; / And they will bring your sons in their arms, / And they will carry your daughters on their shoulders.<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> And kings will be your foster fathers; / And their princesses will be those who nurse you; / They will bow down to you with their faces toward the earth / And lick the dust of your feet; / And you will know that I am Jehovah; / Those who wait on Me will not be ashamed.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Can the booty be taken from the strong man, / Or the lawful captives be delivered?<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Surely, thus says Jehovah, / Even the captive may be taken from the strong man, / And the booty may be released from the tyrant; / For I will strive with those who strive with you, / And I will save your children;<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> And I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; / And they will be drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine; / Then all flesh will know / That I am Jehovah your Savior / And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.<br>

				 <sup>2</sup> Why <i>when</i> I came was there no man? / <i>And when</i> I called <i>why</i> was there no one to answer? / Is My hand so short that it cannot redeem? / Or do I have no power to deliver? / Indeed, at My rebuke I dry up the sea; / I make the rivers a wilderness; / Their fish stink because there is no water, / And die of thirst.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> I clothe the heavens with blackness, / And make sackcloth their covering.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> The Lord Jehovah has given me / The tongue of the instructed, / That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. / He awakens <i>me</i> morning by morning; / He awakens my ear / To hear as an instructed one.<br>

				 <sup>6</sup> I gave my back to those who strike <i>me</i> / And my cheeks to those who pluck out <i>the hair;</i> / I did not hide my face / From humiliation and spitting.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> The Lord Jehovah helps me; / Therefore I have not been dishonored; / Therefore I have set my face like a flint, / And I know that I will not be put to shame.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> The One who justifies me is near; who will contend with me? / Let us stand up together! / Who is my adversary in judgment? / Let him come near to me.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Indeed, the Lord Jehovah helps me, / Who is the one who condemns me? / Indeed, they will all wear out like a garment; / The moth will consume them.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Who among you fears Jehovah; / Who hears the voice of His servant; / Who walks in darkness / And has no light? / Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, / And rely on his God.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Indeed, all of you who kindle a fire, / Who surround yourselves with firebrands, / Walk into the light of your fire / And into the firebrands which you have lit. / You will have this from My hand: / You will lie down in torment.<br>

				 <sup>3</sup> For Jehovah has comforted Zion; / He has comforted all her waste places, / And made her wilderness like Eden, / And her desert like the garden of Jehovah. / Gladness and joy will be found in her, / Thanksgiving and the voice of song.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Hearken to Me, O My people; / Give ear to Me, O My nation; / For instruction will go out from Me; / And I will set My judgment as a light for the peoples.<br>

				 <sup>6</sup> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, / And look upon the earth beneath; / For the heavens will vanish away like smoke, / And the earth will wear out like a garment, / And those who dwell there will die in like manner; / But My salvation will be forever, / And My righteousness will not be abolished.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, / A people in whose heart is My instruction, / Do not fear the reproach of man; / Do not be terrified at their revilings.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> For the moth will eat them up like a garment, / And the worm will eat them like wool; / But My righteousness will be forever, / And My salvation from generation to generation.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Awake, awake! Put on strength, / O arm of Jehovah; / Awake as in the days of old, / <i>As</i> in the generations of past ages. / Was it not You who cut Rahab in pieces, / Who pierced through the dragon?<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Was it not You who dried up the sea, / The waters of the great deep; / Who made the depths of the sea <i>into</i> a way / For the redeemed to pass through?<br>

				 <sup>19</sup> These two things have happened to you; / Who will lament for you? / Desolation and destruction, and famine and sword. / How will I comfort you?<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Your sons have fainted; / They lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net, / Full of the wrath of Jehovah, / The rebuke of your God.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Therefore hear this now, O afflicted one, / You who are drunk but not with wine:<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Thus says your Lord Jehovah and your God / Who pleads the cause of His people, / Indeed, I have taken from your hand / The cup of staggering; / You will no longer need to drink / The bowl of the cup of My wrath anymore;<br>

				 <sup>3</sup> He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; / And like one from whom <i>men</i> hide their faces, / He was despised; and we did not esteem Him.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows; / Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> But He was wounded because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way, / And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; / And as for His generation, who <i>among them</i> had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke <i>was due?</i><br>
				 <sup>9</sup> And they assigned His grave with the wicked, / But with a rich man in His death, / Although He had done no violence, / Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. / When He makes Himself an offering for sin, / He will see a seed, He will extend <i>His</i> days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> He will see <i>the</i> <i>fruit</i> of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous, / And He will bear their iniquities.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Therefore I will divide to Him a portion with the Great, / And He will divide the spoil with the Strong; / Because He poured out His life unto death / And was numbered with the transgressors, / Yet He alone bore the sin of many / And interceded for the transgressors.<br>

				 <sup>8</sup> Then your light will break forth like the dawn, / And your recovery will speedily spring forth. / And your righteousness will go before you; / The glory of Jehovah will guard you from behind.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Then you will call, and Jehovah will answer; / You will cry out, and He will say, Here I am. If you remove the yoke from your midst, / The pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness,<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> And if you draw out your soul to the hungry / And satisfy the desires of the afflicted; / Then your light will rise in the darkness, / And your gloom will be like midday;<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> And Jehovah will guide you continually, / And satisfy your soul in the dry times, / And strengthen your bones; / And you will be like a watered garden, / And like a spring of water, / Whose waters do not deceive.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> And those who are of you will rebuild the ancient ruins; / You will raise up the foundations of generation upon generation; / And you will be called the repairer of the breach, / The restorer of the paths in which to dwell.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, / From doing whatever you please on My holy day, / And call the Sabbath a delight, / That which is holy to Jehovah honorable, / And honor it, not doing your own ways, / Nor finding your own pleasure and speaking <i>idle</i> words;<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Then you will have delight in Jehovah; / And I will cause you to ride upon the heights of the earth, / And I will feed you <i>with</i> the inheritance of Jacob your father; / For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> No, Jehovah’s hand is not so short that it cannot save; / Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> But your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden <i>His</i> face / From you so that He does not hear.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> For your hands are defiled with blood, / And your fingers with iniquity; / Your lips have spoken falsehood, / Your tongue has muttered injustice.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> No one sues righteously, / And no one pleads in truth; / They trust in vanity and speak lies; / They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> They hatch adders’ eggs / And weave the spider’s web; / He who eats of their eggs dies, / And that which is crushed breaks forth into a viper.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Their webs will not become garments, / Nor will they cover themselves with their works; / Their works are works of iniquity, / And an act of violence is in their palms.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Their feet run toward evil, / And they hasten to shed innocent blood; / Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; / Desolation and destruction are in their highways.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> The way of peace they do not know, / And there is no justice in their course; / They have made their paths crooked; / Whoever goes on it does not know peace.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Therefore justice is far from us, / And righteousness does not overtake us; / We look eagerly for light, but, ah, darkness, / For brightness, <i>but</i> we walk in gloom.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> We grope like blind men at the wall; / We grope like those without eyes; / We stumble at midday as <i>we would</i> at dusk; / Among the prospering we are like dead men.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> All of us roar like bears / And moan incessantly like doves; / We look eagerly for justice, but there is none, / For salvation, <i>but</i> it is far from us.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> For our transgressions are multiplied before You, / And our sins respond <i>to You</i> against us; / For our transgressions are with us, / And as for our iniquities, we know <i>what</i> they <i>are:</i><br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Transgressing and denying Jehovah, / And turning away from our God; / Speaking oppression and revolt, / Conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And justice is turned back, / And righteousness stands far off; / For truth has stumbled in the street, / And uprightness cannot come in.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> And truth is lacking, / And he who turns from evil becomes plunder. And Jehovah saw <i>it,</i> and it was evil in His sight / That there was no justice.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> And He saw that there was no man, / And He was appalled that there was no intercessor. / Therefore His arm accomplished salvation for Him, / And His righteousness sustained Him.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Thus He put on righteousness as a breastplate, / And a helmet of salvation upon His head; / And He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing / And wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> According to <i>their</i> dealings, so will He repay: / Wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; / To the coastlands He will repay with recompense.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> So they will fear the name of Jehovah from the west, / And His glory from the rising of the sun; / When the adversary comes like a flood, / The Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a standard against him.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> And a Redeemer will come to Zion, / And unto those who turn from transgression in Jacob, / Declares Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> And as for Me, this is My covenant with them, says Jehovah: My Spirit which is upon you and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your seed, nor from the mouth of your seed’s seed, says Jehovah, from now and forever.<br>

				 <sup>16</sup> And you will suck the milk of nations / And suck the breast of kings; / Thus you will know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior / And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Instead of bronze I will bring gold, / And instead of iron I will bring silver; / And instead of wood <i>there will be</i> bronze, / And instead of stones <i>there will be</i> iron; / And I will make peace your officers, / And righteousness your rulers.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Violence will no longer be heard in your land, / Nor desolation and destruction within your borders; / But you will call your walls Salvation, / And your gates Praise.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> You will no longer have the sun for <i>your</i> light by day, / Nor for brightness will the moon give you light; / But Jehovah will be an eternal light to you, / And your God your beauty.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Your sun will no longer go down, / Nor will your moon withdraw; / For Jehovah will be an eternal light to you, / And the days of your mourning will be ended.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Then all your people will be righteous; / They will possess the land forever, / The branch of My planting, / The work of My hands, / That I may be beautified.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> I let Myself be inquired of by those who did not ask <i>for Me,</i> / And found by those who did not seek Me. / I said, Here I am; here I am; / To a nation that was not called by My name.<br>

				 <sup>13</sup> As one whom his mother comforts, / So will I comfort you; / And you will be comforted in Jerusalem.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And you will see <i>this,</i> and your heart will rejoice, / And your bones will flourish like new grass; / And the hand of Jehovah will be made known to His servants, / And He will be indignant toward His enemies.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, / And His chariots will be like a whirlwind, / To render His anger with fury / And His rebuke with flames of fire.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> For with fire Jehovah will execute judgment, / And with His sword, upon all flesh; / And those slain by Jehovah will be many.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Those who sanctify and purify themselves for the gardens, / Following after one in the midst, / Eating swine’s flesh / And what is abominable and <i>even</i> mice, / Will come to an end together, declares Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> But I — their works and their thoughts <i>I will repay;</i> the time is coming to gather all the nations and tongues; and they will come and see My glory.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> And I will set a sign among them and will send those who have escaped from them unto the nations: <i>to</i> Tarshish, Put, and Lud, <i>to</i> those who draw the bow; <i>to</i> Tubal and Javan, <i>to</i> the distant coastlands that have not heard My fame nor seen My glory; and they will declare My glory among the nations.<br>

				 <sup>24</sup> Then they will go forth and look / On the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; / For their worm will not die, / Nor will their fire be quenched; / And they will be an abhorrence to all flesh.<br>
