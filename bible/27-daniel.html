			<h4 id="daniel-1">Daniel 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim the king of Judah Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then the king told Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs, to bring some of the sons of Israel, including some from the royal seed and from the nobility,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Children in whom was no defect, <i>who were</i> good in appearance, who showed insight in all wisdom, understanding in knowledge, and apprehension in thought, and in whom was the ability to stand in the king’s palace. And <i>he told him</i> to teach them the learning and language of the Chaldeans.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the king appointed to them a daily portion from the king’s choice provision and from the wine that he drank, and <i>appointed</i> that they should be brought up for three years so that at the end of the time they might stand before the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Now among these from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the leader of the eunuchs gave them names: he gave Daniel <i>the name</i> Belteshazzar; Hananiah, <i>the name</i> Shadrach; Mishael, <i>the name</i> Meshach; and Azariah, <i>the name</i> Abed-nego.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But Daniel set his heart not to defile himself with the king’s choice provision and with the wine that the king drank, so he requested of the leader of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the leader of the eunuchs;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the leader of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink; for why should he see your faces being more morose than <i>those of</i> the children who are of your own age? Then you would bring guilt upon my head before the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then Daniel said to the steward whom the leader of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Please test your servants for ten days, and let vegetables be given to us to eat and water to drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then let our countenances be watched in your presence, as well as the countenances of the children who eat the king’s choice provision; and do with your servants according to what you see.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better, and they were more fully fleshed than all the children who ate the king’s choice provision.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Therefore the steward withheld their <i>portion of</i> the choice provision and the wine that they were to drink and gave them vegetables.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Now as for these four children, God gave them knowledge and insight in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then at the end of the days when the king had said that <i>the children</i> should be brought in, the leader of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the king spoke with them. And among them all none were found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they stood in the presence of the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And in every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king.<br><br>

			<h4 id="daniel-2">Daniel 2</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the king ordered the call for the magicians, conjurers, sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to declare to the king his dreams; and they came in and stood before the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The command from me is published: If you do not make the dream and its interpretation known to me, you shall be cut into pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive gifts and a reward and much honor from me. Therefore declare the dream and its interpretation to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> They answered a second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> The king answered and said, I know for certain that you are trying to buy time because you have seen that the command from me is published.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one decree for you; for you have agreed together to speak false and corrupt words before me until the time is changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can declare its interpretation to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, There is not a man upon the earth who can declare the matter for the king, because no great king or ruler has ever asked any magician, conjurer, or Chaldean for something like this.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the thing that the king asks is rare, and there is no one else who can declare it before the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and he gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions so that they might be slain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Then Daniel responded in counsel and with discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king’s bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> He answered and said to Arioch, the king’s commander, Why is the decree from before the king so harsh? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Daniel then went in and sought from the king that he would give him a time to declare the interpretation to the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> That they might request compassions from before the God of the heavens concerning this mystery so that Daniel and his companions would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Daniel answered and said,Let the name of God / Be blessed from eternity to eternity, / For wisdom and might are His.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And it is He who changes the times and seasons; / He deposes kings and causes kings to ascend. / He gives wisdom to the wise / And knowledge to those who have understanding.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> He reveals the deep things and the hidden things; / He knows what is <i>obscured</i> in the darkness, / And the light dwells with Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> To You, O God of my fathers, I render thanks and praise, / For You have given me wisdom and might; / And You have now made known to me what we requested of You, / For You have made known the king’s matter to us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him, Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me before the king, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then Arioch brought Daniel hurriedly before the king and spoke in this way to him, I have found a man among the captives of Judah who will make the interpretation known to the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Daniel answered before the king and said, As to the mystery which the king has inquired about, no wise men, <i>no</i> conjurers, magicians, <i>or</i> diviners, are able to declare <i>it</i> to the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> But there is a God in the heavens who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the last days. This is your dream, even the visions of your head upon your bed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> As for you, O king, your thoughts on your bed came upon what would happen after these <i>times,</i> and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will happen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me because of some wisdom that is in me more than in any <i>other</i> living person, but so that the interpretation may be made known to the king and that you may understand the thoughts of your heart.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> You, O king, were watching, and there was a single great image. This image, large and its brightness surpassing, stood opposite you; and its appearance was frightful.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Concerning this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its abdomen and its thighs of bronze,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> You were watching until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the image at its feet of iron and clay and crushed them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at once, and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of the heavens has given kingship, power, and strength and glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And wherever the children of men, the beasts of the field, or the birds of the sky dwell, He has given <i>them</i> into your hand and has made you ruler over all of them. You are the head of gold.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And after you another kingdom will arise, inferior to you; and <i>there will be</i> another kingdom, a third one, of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters everything; and like iron that smashes all these, it will crush and smash.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> And in that you saw the feet and the toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom will be a confused mass; but there will be some of the firmness of iron in it, for you saw the iron mixed with the earthy clay.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And <i>as</i> the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, <i>so</i> some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be fragile.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> And in that you saw the iron mixed with the earthy clay, they will be mixed together through the seed of men, but they will not cleave to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And in the days of those kings the God of the heavens will raise up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and its reign will not be left to another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms; and it will stand forever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Inasmuch as you saw that out of the mountain a stone was cut without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will happen afterward; and the dream is certain, and its interpretation trustworthy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel and commanded that they offer an oblation and incense to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> The king answered Daniel and said, It is certain that your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a Revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> Then the king made Daniel great and gave many great gifts to him; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief of the prefects over all the wise men of Babylon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was at the king’s court.<br><br>

			<h4 id="daniel-3">Daniel 3</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, its height sixty cubits <i>and</i> its width six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the chief judges, the treasury officials, the law officials, the judges, and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the chief judges, the treasury officials, the law officials, the judges, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled themselves for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then a herald proclaimed loudly, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> At the time that you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace of fire in that very hour.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Because of this at that time certain Chaldeans drew near and accused the Jews.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live forever!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> There are certain Jews, whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon — Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego — these men have not respected you, O king; they do not serve your gods nor worship the golden image that you have set up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded <i>men</i> to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; then they brought these men before the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, Do you, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, purposely not serve my gods nor worship the golden image that I have set up?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Now then, if, at the time when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you are ready to fall down and worship the image that I have made, <i>very well;</i> but if you do not worship, you will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace of fire in that very hour; and who is that god who will deliver you out of my hands?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, there is no need for us to give you an answer in this matter.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> If it be <i>so,</i> our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace of fire, and He will deliver <i>us</i> out of your hand, O king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> But if <i>He does</i> not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image that you have set up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury and the countenance of his face was changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He responded and commanded that the furnace be made seven times hotter than it was usually heated.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And he commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and throw <i>them</i> into the blazing furnace of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then these men were bound in their shirts, tunics, and mantles, and <i>other</i> clothing, and thrown into the midst of the blazing furnace of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> For this reason, because the king’s word was so harsh and the furnace had been heated to an extreme, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the blazing furnace of fire bound up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and stood up in haste; he responded and said to his counselors, Did we not throw three men into the midst of the fire bound up? They answered and said to the king, Certainly, O king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> He answered and said, Look, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not harmed. And the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the blazing furnace of fire. He responded and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, servants of God the Most High, come out and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the satraps, prefects, and governors, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw concerning these men that the fire had no effect on their bodies and <i>that</i> the hair of their heads was not singed, nor had their clothes been affected, nor had the smell of fire come upon them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him and changed the king’s word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language that speaks something offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego shall be cut into pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon.<br><br>

			<h4 id="daniel-4">Daniel 4</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in the whole earth: May your peace abound!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> It pleases me to declare the signs and wonders that God the Most High has done for me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> How great are His signs, / And how mighty are His wonders! / His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, / And His dominion is from generation to generation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and was flourishing in my palace.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> I saw a dream and it frightened me, and the imaginings upon my bed and the visions of my head alarmed me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore I made the decree to bring before me all the wise men of Babylon that they might make the interpretation of the dream known to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans, and diviners came in, and I told the dream to them; but they could not make its interpretation known to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But at last there came in before me Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream to him, <i>saying,</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery troubles you, <i>here are</i> the visions of my dream that I have seen; now tell <i>me</i> its interpretation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now <i>these were</i> the visions of my head upon my bed: I was watching and there was a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> The tree grew great and became strong, / And its height reached to heaven, / And the sight of it to the end of all the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, / And in it was food for all. / The beasts of the field found shade under it, / And the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches; / And all flesh fed from it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I was watching in the visions of my head upon my bed, and there was a watcher, indeed, a holy one, coming down from heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> He cried out loudly and spoke in this way, / Cut down the tree and cut off its branches; / Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit; / Let the beasts flee from under it, / And the birds from its branches.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Yet leave its stump of roots / In the earth, / But with an iron and bronze band <i>around it,</i> / In the tender grass of the field; / And let him be wet with the dew of heaven, / And let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Let his heart be changed from that of a man, / And let a beast’s heart be given to him; / And let seven periods of time pass over him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision is a command of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the Most High is the Ruler over the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He wills and sets up over it the lowliest of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell <i>me</i> the interpretation, inasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make the interpretation known to me; but you are able, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while as his thoughts alarmed him. The king responded and said, Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you, and its interpretation for your enemies!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The tree that you saw, which grew great and became strong, and whose height reached to heaven and the sight of it to all the earth,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, <i>and</i> under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the birds of the sky lodged —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> It is you, O king, who have grown great and become strong, for your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And in that the king saw a watcher, indeed, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, Cut down the tree and destroy it; yet leave its stump of roots in the earth, but with an iron and bronze band <i>around it,</i> in the tender grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> You shall be driven out from among mankind, and with the beasts of the field shall your dwelling place be; and you shall be made to eat grass as bulls <i>do</i> and shall be wet with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you come to know that the Most High is the Ruler over the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He wills.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And in that it was commanded that the stump of roots of the tree be left, your kingdom will be assured to you after you have come to know that the heavens do rule.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: Break off your sins by doing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; perhaps there may be a prolonging of your prosperity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> All this came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> At the end of twelve months he was walking upon <i>the roof of</i> the royal palace of Babylon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> The king responded and said, Is this not Babylon the great, which I have built up as a royal house by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> While the word was still in the king’s mouth, a voice came down from heaven: To you it is spoken, King Nebuchadnezzar: The kingdom has passed on from you;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And from among mankind you shall be driven out, and with the beasts of the field shall your dwelling place be; you shall be made to eat grass as bulls <i>do;</i> and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you come to know that the Most High is the Ruler over the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He wills.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> In that very hour the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and from among mankind he was driven out, and he began to eat grass as bulls <i>do,</i> and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hair had grown like eagles’ <i>feathers</i> and his nails like birds’ <i>claws.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And at the end of <i>those</i> days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me; and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored the ever-living One;For His dominion is an eternal dominion, / And His kingdom is from generation to generation;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And all the inhabitants of earth are considered as nothing, / But He does according to His will in the army of heaven / And <i>among</i> the inhabitants of the earth; / And there is no one who can resist His hand / Or say to Him, What are You doing?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> At that time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and my splendor returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought me out, and I was established in my kingdom, and surpassing greatness was added to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the King of the heavens, because all His works are truth and His ways justice, and because He is able to abase those who walk in pride.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords; and he drank wine before the thousand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Belshazzar, under the influence of the wine, commanded <i>men</i> to bring the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his forefather had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then they brought the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple of the house of God, which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> At that moment the fingers of a man’s hand came forth and wrote opposite the lampstand upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace. And the king saw <i>that</i> part of the hand that wrote.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then the king’s countenance changed and his thoughts alarmed him; and the joints of his hips loosened and his knees began to knock together.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> The king cried loudly to bring the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the diviners. The king responded and said to the wise men of Babylon, Any man who reads this writing and declares its interpretation to me shall be clothed in purple and <i>shall have</i> a chain of gold around his neck and shall rule as the third <i>ruler</i> in the kingdom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then all the king’s wise men came, but they could not read the writing nor make its interpretation known to the king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed; his countenance was <i>further</i> changed, and his lords were perplexed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> The queen mother, because of the words of the king and his lords, came to the banquet house. The queen mother responded and said, O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you, nor let your countenance change.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your forefather light and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar your forefather — your forefather, O king — made him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans, <i>and</i> diviners,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Because an excellent spirit and knowledge and insight, <i>and</i> the interpretation of dreams, the declaring of riddles, and the resolving of problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Let Daniel now be called, and he will declare the interpretation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Daniel was brought before the king. The king responded and said to Daniel, Are you Daniel, one of the captives of Judah, whom my forefather the king brought from Judah?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Now I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you and <i>that</i> light and insight and surpassing wisdom are found in you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And now the wise men, the conjurers, have been brought in before me that they might read this writing and make its interpretation known to me, but they cannot declare the interpretation of the thing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But I have heard about you that you can give interpretations and resolve problems. If you can now read the writing and make its interpretation known to me, you shall be clothed in purple and <i>shall have</i> a chain of gold around your neck and shall rule as the third <i>ruler</i> in the kingdom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let your gifts remain with you, or give your rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing for the king and make the interpretation known to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Regarding you, O king, God the Most High gave to Nebuchadnezzar your forefather kingship, greatness, glory, and majesty;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And because of the greatness which He gave to him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him; whomever he wished he slew, and whomever he wished he kept alive, and whomever he wished he raised up, and whomever he wished he brought down.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so arrogant that he conducted himself in pride, he was deposed from his royal throne, and <i>his</i> glory was taken away from him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like that of the beasts, and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys; <i>men</i> fed him with grass as <i>they do</i> bulls, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he came to know that God the Most High is the Ruler over the kingdom of men and sets over it whomever He wills.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And you his descendant, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But you have exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and of gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see nor hear nor know. But the God in whose hand is your breath and to whom all your ways <i>belong,</i> you have not honored.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then <i>that</i> part of the hand was sent from before Him, and this writing was inscribed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE — God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> TEKEL — You have been weighed in the scales and found to be lacking.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> PERES — Your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Then Belshazzar commanded; and they clothed Daniel in purple and <i>put</i> a chain of gold around his neck, and they made the proclamation concerning him that he should rule as the third <i>ruler</i> in the kingdom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> In that very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two.<br><br>

			<h4 id="daniel-6">Daniel 6</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> It pleased Darius to set up over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who would be throughout the whole kingdom;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And over them, three chief ministers — of whom Daniel was one — so that these satraps might give account to them and the king might not suffer loss.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then this Daniel distinguished himself among the chief ministers and satraps because in him there was an excellent spirit, and the king considered setting him over the whole kingdom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then the chief ministers and satraps sought to find a ground for accusation against Daniel from the perspective of the kingdom, but they could find no ground for accusation or fault, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or fault was found related to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then these men said, We will not find any ground for accusation against this Daniel unless we find <i>something</i> related to him due to the law of his God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then these chief ministers and satraps came to prevail upon the king and said thus to him, King Darius, live forever!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> All the chief ministers of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have taken counsel together that the king should establish a statute and make firm an edict that anyone who makes a petition within the <i>next</i> thirty days to any god or man besides you, O king, shall be cast into the lions’ den.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Now, O king, establish the edict and sign the writing, so that it is not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot pass away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore King Darius signed the writing, that is, the edict.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now when Daniel came to know that the writing had been signed, he went to his house (in his upper room he had windows open toward Jerusalem) and three times daily he knelt on his knees and prayed and gave thanks before his God, because he had <i>always</i> done so previously.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then these men assembled and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then they came near and spoke before the king concerning the king’s edict: Did you not sign an edict that anyone who petitions, within the <i>next</i> thirty days, any god or man besides you, O king, shall be cast into the lions’ den? The king answered and said, The thing is certain, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot pass away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then they answered and said before the king, Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, has not respected you, O king, or the edict that you have signed, but three times daily makes his petition.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Then the king, when he heard the thing, was very displeased with himself and set his heart on delivering Daniel; and until the sun set, he made efforts to deliver him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then these men came to prevail upon the king and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or statute which the king establishes can be changed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel and threw <i>him</i> into the lions’ den. The king responded and said to Daniel, Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And a stone was brought and set over the mouth of the den. And the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet rings of his lords that nothing might be changed regarding Daniel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no entertainment was brought before him, and his sleep fled from him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then the king arose at dawn at the first light, and went in haste to the lions’ den.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And when he had come near the den, he shouted to Daniel with a sad voice; the king responded and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> My God has sent His angel and has shut the lions’ mouth, and they have not hurt me, inasmuch as before Him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then the king was very pleased concerning him, and he commanded that they take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and he was found completely unhurt, because he had trusted in his God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel and threw <i>them</i> into the lions’ den, them, their children, and their wives; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in the whole land: May your peace abound!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;For He is the living God / And enduring forever; / And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, / And His dominion will be unto the end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> He delivers and rescues, / And He does signs and wonders / In heaven and on earth; / <i>It is He</i> who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.<br><br>

			<h4 id="daniel-7">Daniel 7</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed. Then he wrote down the dream; he related the sum of the matters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Daniel responded and said, I was watching in my vision by night, and there were the four winds of heaven, stirring up the Great Sea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man; and a man’s heart was given to it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And there was another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> After this I watched and there was another <i>beast,</i> like a leopard; and it had four wings of a bird on its back; and the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> After this I watched in the night visions, and there was a fourth beast, dreadful and frightful and exceedingly strong; and it had large iron teeth; it devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I was considering the horns; then there was another horn, a small one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted from before it. And there were eyes like the eyes of a man in this horn and a mouth speaking great things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I watched / Until thrones were set, / And the Ancient of Days sat down. / His clothing was like white snow, / And the hair of His head was like pure wool; / His throne was flames of fire, / Its wheels, burning fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> A stream of fire issued forth / And came out from before Him. / Thousands of thousands ministered to Him, / And ten thousands of ten thousands stood before Him. / The court of judgment sat, / And the books were opened.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> I watched then because of the sound of the great things that the horn was speaking; I watched until the beast was slain and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for a season and a time.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I watched in the night visions, / And there with the clouds of heaven / One like a Son of Man was coming; / And He came to the Ancient of Days, / And they brought Him near before Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And to Him was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, / That all the peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him. / His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away; / And His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was distressed, and the visions of my head alarmed me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> I came near to one of those standing by and asked of him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made the interpretation of the things known to me:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings <i>who</i> will arise from the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, indeed, forever and ever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then I wished to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, <i>which</i> devoured, crushed, and trampled under the remainder with its feet,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And of the ten horns that were on its head, and the other <i>horn</i> that came up, and before which three <i>horns</i> fell, even that horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking great things and whose appearance was greater than that of its companions.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> I watched and that horn waged war with the saints and prevailed against them,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Until the Ancient of Days came; and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Thus he said, The fourth beast will be the fourth kingdom upon the earth, which will be different from all the <i>other</i> kingdoms; and it will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise, and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones; and he will subdue three kings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he will speak things against the Most High and wear out the saints of the Most High; and his intention will be to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand for a time and times and half a time.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> But the court of judgment will sit, and they will take away his dominion, so as to annihilate and destroy <i>it</i> unto the end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts alarmed me greatly, and my countenance was changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.<br><br>
			</p>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="daniel-8">Daniel 8</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that appeared to me at the beginning.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And I looked in the vision, and while I looked, now I was in the fortress of Shushan, which is in the province of Elam; and while I looked in the vision, I was beside the river Ulai.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then I lifted my eyes, and I looked, and there was a ram, standing before the river, and he had two horns. And the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other; and the higher one came up last.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward; and no beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could deliver from his power; but he did as he pleased, and he became great.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And while I considered <i>this,</i> there was a male goat, coming from the west over the face of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran toward him in his mighty wrath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and broke his two horns; and the ram had no strength to withstand him, but <i>the goat</i> threw him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was none to deliver the ram from his power.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the male goat became very great. But once he became strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew very great toward the south, toward the east, and toward that which is beautiful.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And it grew great, as high as the host of heaven; and it caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Indeed, he grew in greatness to <i>that of</i> the Prince of the host; and from Him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And an army was given <i>to him</i> together with the daily sacrifice because of transgression; and he cast truth down to the ground, and he took action and prospered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the particular one who was speaking, How long will the vision <i>concerning</i> the daily sacrifice and the transgression that desolates apply, so that the sanctuary and the host are trampled down?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he said to me, For two thousand three hundred nights and days; then the sanctuary will be cleansed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought an understanding <i>of it;</i> and immediately <i>there was</i> someone with an appearance like that of a man standing before me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And I heard the voice of a man between <i>the banks of</i> the Ulai; and He called out and said, Gabriel, cause this man to understand the vision.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> So he came near to where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and I fell on my face; but he said to me, Understand, O son of man, that the vision pertains to the end time.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep on my face upon the ground; but he touched me and made me stand in my place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And he said, I now make known to you what will happen at the end of the indignation, for <i>the vision</i> pertains to the appointed time of the end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The ram that you saw, which had the two horns, are the kings of Media and Persia.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the hairy goat is the king of Javan; and the great horn which was between its eyes is the first king.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And the broken <i>horn</i> and the four <i>horns</i> that arose in its place are four kingdoms that will arise from <i>his</i> nation, but not with his power.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And in the latter time of their kingdom, / When the transgressors have filled up <i>their transgressions,</i> / A king will arise, / Of fierce countenance and skilled in ambiguities.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And his power will be mighty, but not by his <i>own</i> power. / And he will destroy in an extraordinary manner / And will prosper and take action. / He will destroy mighty men / And the holy people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Through his craftiness / He will also cause deceit to prosper in his hand; / And he will magnify <i>himself</i> in his heart; / And he will destroy many <i>who are</i> complacently secure. / And against the Prince of princes he will stand up; / But he will be broken, <i>yet</i> not by <i>human</i> hands.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the vision of the evenings and the mornings, / Which has been told, is true. / But shut the vision up, / For it pertains to <i>something</i> many days <i>from now.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Then I, Daniel, was spent, and I was sick for days. Then I arose and conducted the king’s affairs; but I was astonished at the vision, and there was no one to explain <i>it.</i><br><br>

			<h4 id="daniel-9">Daniel 9</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, a Median descendant who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> In the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by means of the Scriptures the number of the years, which came as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, <i>that is,</i> seventy years.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> So I set my face toward the Lord God to seek <i>Him</i> in prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I prayed to Jehovah my God and confessed; and I said, Ah, Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> We have sinned and have committed iniquity, and we have acted wickedly and rebelled, <i>to the point of</i> even turning away from Your commandments and from Your judgments.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our chief men, and our fathers, as well as to all the people of the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> To You, Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us, shamefacedness, as it is this day, <i>that is,</i> to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far off in all the lands to which You have driven them because of their trespass by which they have trespassed against You.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> O Jehovah, to us belongs shamefacedness, to our kings, our chief men, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in His instruction, which He set before us through the hand of His servants the prophets.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Indeed, all Israel has transgressed Your law, <i>to the point of</i> even turning away so as not to obey Your voice; thus the curse has been poured out upon us, the very oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And He has confirmed His words which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us great ill; for under all heaven there has not been done anything like that which has been done in Jerusalem.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> As it is written in the law of Moses, all this ill has come upon us, yet we have not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God by turning from our iniquities and attending to Your truth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Therefore Jehovah has been vigilant with the ill and has brought it upon us, for Jehovah our God is righteous in all the deeds that He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made for Yourself a name, as it is this day, we have sinned, we have been wicked.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> O Lord, in accordance with all the manifestations of Your righteousness, may Your anger and Your wrath be turned away, I pray, from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all those around us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And now hear, O our God, the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, and cause Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary that has been desolated, for the Lord’s sake.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city that is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our supplications before You based upon any righteous doings that we have done, but based upon Your great compassion.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God; for Your city and Your people are called by Your <i>own</i> name.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And while I was still speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Even while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, reached me in <i>my</i> utter exhaustion about the time of the evening oblation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And he informed <i>me</i> and talked with me and said, Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight with understanding.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> At the beginning of your supplications the command went forth, and I have come to tell <i>you,</i> for you are preciousness itself. Therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Seventy weeks are apportioned for your people and for your holy city, to close the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make propitiation for iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Know therefore and comprehend: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until <i>the time of</i> Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with street and trench, even in distressful times.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing; and the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end <i>there will be</i> war; desolations are determined.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week; and in the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator, even until the complete destruction that has been determined is poured out upon the desolator.<br><br>

			<h4 id="daniel-10">Daniel 10</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the third year of Cyrus the king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the word was true and <i>concerning</i> a great distress. And he understood the word and had an understanding of the vision.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> In those days I, Daniel, had been mourning for three full weeks.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> I ate no desirable food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, until the three full weeks were completed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the great river, that is, the Hiddekel,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there was a certain man, clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with the fine gold of Uphaz.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> His body also was like beryl, His face like the appearance of lightning, His eyes like torches of fire, His arms and His feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of His words like the sound of a multitude.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; instead, a great dread fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Thus I was left alone and I saw this great vision; and no strength was left in me, but my color turned deathly pale; and I retained no strength.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Yet I heard the sound of His words; and when I heard the sound of His words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And at that moment a hand touched me and sent me trembling on my knees and the palms of my hands.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And he said to me, Daniel, man of preciousness, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand in your place, for I have now been sent to you. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he said to me, Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand <i>this matter</i> and to afflict yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me for twenty-one days; but now Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I remained there <i>alone</i> with the kings of Persia.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Thus I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the last days, yet the vision pertains to <i>something many</i> days <i>from now.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face to the ground and was dumb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And at that moment one who resembled the sons of men touched my lips; and I opened my mouth and spoke, and I said to him who stood before me, Sir, because of the vision my anguish has turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For how can such a servant of my lord speak with such as my lord? For as for me, just now there is no strength in me, nor has there been breath left in me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then the one who was in appearance like a man touched me again and strengthened me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And he said, Do not be afraid, man of preciousness. Peace to you. Be strong, yes, be strong. And when he spoke to me, I received strength and said, Speak, sir, for you have strengthened me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then he said, Do you know why I have come to you? And now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia; so I go forth, and the prince of Javan is now about to come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> However I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. Yet there is no one who holds strongly with me against these ones except Michael your prince.<br><br>

			<h4 id="daniel-11">Daniel 11</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, stood up to support and strengthen him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And now I will tell you the truth. There will yet arise three kings in Persia; then the fourth will gain great riches, more than all <i>of them;</i> and once he becomes strong because of his riches, he will stir up the whole <i>empire</i> against the realm of Javan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And a mighty king will arise <i>there,</i> and he will rule with great dominion and do as he pleases.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But once he arises, his kingdom will be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be plucked up and <i>given</i> to others besides his descendants.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the king of the south will become strong, as well as <i>one</i> of his princes, who will grow in strength above him and have dominion; his dominion will be a great dominion.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And at the end of some years they will join themselves together. And the daughter of the king of the south will go to the king of the north and make a treaty; but she will not retain the strength of her arm, nor will he and his arm stand; but she will be given up, along with those who brought her <i>into the alliance</i> and him who begot her and supported her in those times.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But a shoot from her roots will arise in his place, and he will come against the army and enter into the fortress of the king of the north; and he will deal with them and show his strength.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And also their gods with their cast images, with their precious vessels of silver and gold, he will carry off into captivity in Egypt; and for <i>some</i> years he will refrain from the king of the north.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the king of the north will come to the kingdom of the king of the south, but he will return to his <i>own</i> land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But his sons will stir themselves up to war and will gather a multitude of great forces; and one will come unrelentingly and will overflow and pass through and will return and wage war, <i>even</i> up to the fortress of the king of the south.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the king of the south will be enraged and will come forth to fight with him, with the king of the north. Then the king of the north will raise up a great multitude, but the multitude will be given into the hand of the king of the south.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> When the multitude is carried away, the heart of the king of the south will be lifted up; and he will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not prevail.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For the king of the north will return, and he will raise up a multitude greater than the first; and at the end of some years he will come unrelentingly with a great army and with much materiel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And in those times many will rise up against the king of the south; and the violent ones of your people will lift themselves up to establish the vision, but they will fall.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then the king of the north will come and cast up a siege mound and capture the fortified city; and the forces of the south will not stand, nor his choice people, for there will be no strength to stand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But he who comes against the king of the south will do as he pleases; and no one will stand before him. And he will stand in the beautiful land, and destruction will be in his hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he will set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him <i>there will be</i> terms of peace that he will act upon. And he will give the king of the south a youthful daughter, to destroy it; yet she will not be able to stand <i>for him,</i> but will be of no use to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and will capture many. But a leader, for his own sake, will put an end to the reproach caused by him; indeed, he will turn his reproach back on him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then the king of the north will turn his face to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and will not be found.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then there will arise in his place one who will cause an oppressor to pass through the splendor of the kingdom; yet within a few days he will be broken, but not while <i>venting his</i> anger nor <i>pursuing</i> battle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then there will arise in his place a despicable person, to whom the honor of a kingdom will not be given; but he will come in a time of security and will seize the kingdom by smooth and cunning words and actions.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And the overflowing forces will be flooded over before him and broken, even also the prince of the covenant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And once he has made an alliance with him, he will practice deceit and will go up and become mighty with a small <i>group of</i> people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> In a time of security he will enter even the richest parts of the kingdom and will do that which his fathers never did, nor his fathers’ fathers; prey, spoil, and riches will he scatter among them, and against strongholds he will devise strategies, but <i>only</i> for a while.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he will stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will stir himself up to wage war with an extremely great and mighty army <i>of his own;</i> but he will not stand, for strategies will have been devised against him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And those who eat of his choice provision will destroy him; and his army will overflow, and many will fall down slain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And as for both of these kings, their hearts will be to do evil, and they will speak lies across one table; but <i>what they do</i> will not succeed, for the end is still at the appointed time.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Then the king of the north will return to his land with great riches; but his heart will be <i>set</i> against the holy covenant, and he will take action and will return to his land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> At the appointed time he will return and come against the south; but this latter time will not be like the former time.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will turn away; and he will be enraged at the holy covenant and will take action. When he turns away, he will focus his attention on those who forsake the holy covenant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And forces from him will arise and profane the sanctuary, <i>establishing</i> the fortress and removing the daily sacrifice; and they will set up the abomination that desolates.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And with his smooth words he will cause those who act wickedly toward the covenant to be profane. But the people who know their God will show strength and take action.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And those with insight among the people will cause the many to understand; yet they will fall by sword and by flames, by captivity and by plundering for <i>some</i> days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; and many will join themselves to them in word only.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And some of those with insight will fall, in order to refine the people and to purify and cleanse <i>them,</i> until the time of the end, for <i>the end</i> is still at the appointed time.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And the king will do as he pleases; and he will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and against the God of gods he will speak extraordinary things; and he will prosper until the indignation is complete; for what has been determined will be done.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And he will not regard the gods of his fathers or the desire of women, nor will he regard any <i>other</i> god; for he will magnify himself above all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> But he will honor instead the god of fortresses; indeed a god whom his fathers did not know he will honor with gold, silver, precious stones, and treasures.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And he will take action against the most fortified of fortresses with <i>the help of</i> a foreign god; he will increase the honor of those who acknowledge <i>him</i> and will cause them to rule over many, and he will divide the land <i>to them</i> as a reward.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And at the time of the end the king of the south will push against him, and the king of the north will storm <i>back</i> at him with chariots and horsemen and many ships; and he will enter the countries and overflow and pass through.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> He will also enter the beautiful land, and many <i>countries</i> will fall; but these will slip away from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the foremost of the children of Ammon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> Then he will stretch forth his hand against the countries, and for the land of Egypt there will be no escape.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> And he will have control over the hidden stores of gold and silver and over all the precious things of the Egyptians; and the Libyans and Cushites will <i>follow</i> in his steps.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> But news from the east and from the north will trouble him, and he will go forth with great wrath destroying and exterminating many.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> And he will pitch the tents of his palace between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain; but he will come to his end, and there will be no one to help him.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And at that time Michael, the great prince who stands for the children of your people, will arise; and there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time; and at that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And many of those who are sleeping in the dust of the ground will awake, some to life eternal and some to reproach, to eternal contempt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And those who have insight will shine like the shining of the heavenly expanse, and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars, forever and ever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end; many will go here and there, and knowledge will be increased.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then I, Daniel, looked, and there were two others standing, one on this bank of the river and the other on that bank of the river.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the water of the river, How long <i>will it be</i> until the end of these wonders?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the water of the river, as He lifted up His right hand and His left hand to heaven and swore by Him who lives forever that there would be a time and times and half <i>a time;</i> and when the shattering of the power of the holy people is completed, all these things will be completed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, My Lord, what will the latter end of these things be?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And He said, Go <i>your way,</i> Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And from the time that the daily sacrifice is removed and the abomination that desolates is set up, <i>there will be</i> a thousand two hundred and ninety days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Blessed is he who waits and reaches the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But you, go <i>your way</i> until the end, and you will rest and rise <i>again</i> in your lot at the end of the days.<br><br>
