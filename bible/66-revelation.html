			<h4 id="revelation-1">Revelation 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, even all that he saw.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep the things written in it, for the time is near.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him. Yes, amen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> I was in spirit on the Lord’s Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Saying, What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun shines in its power.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead; and He placed His right hand on me, saying, Do not fear; I am the First and the Last<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. <br><br>
			</p>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="revelation-2">Revelation 2</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And to the messenger of the church in Smyrna write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I know your tribulation and poverty (but you are rich) and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And to the messenger of the church in Pergamos write: These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is; and you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except him who receives it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And to the messenger of the church in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, He who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like shining bronze:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> But I say to you — the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say — I put no other burden upon you;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And to him I will give the morning star.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. <br><br>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="revelation-3">Revelation 3</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars:        I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews and are not, but lie — behold, I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that I have loved you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And to the messenger of the church in Laodicea write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of My mouth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> As many as I love I reprove and discipline; be zealous therefore and repent.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. <br><br>

			<h4 id="revelation-4">Revelation 4</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And around the throne there were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and upon their heads golden crowns.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea like crystal; and in the midst of the throne and around the throne, there were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings apiece, are full of eyes around and within; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And when the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> The twenty-four elders will fall before Him who sits upon the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever; and they will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created. <br><br>

			<h4 id="revelation-5">Revelation 5</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I saw on the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And no one in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And one of the elders said to me, Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and of the living creatures and of the elders, and their number was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them, I heard saying, To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.<br><br>

			<h4 id="revelation-6">Revelation 6</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying like the sound of thunder, Come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sits on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I saw, and behold, another horse, a red one, went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him authority was given to take peace from the earth, and that men should slay one another; and to him a great sword was given.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sits on it had a balance in his hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying: A choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and he who sits upon it, his name is Death; and Hades followed with him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And to each of them was given a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until also the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed, even as they were, is completed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And heaven was removed like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And I saw another Angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom authority was given to harm the earth and the sea,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Saying, Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we seal the slaves of our God upon their foreheads.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed; out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Saying, Amen. The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanks and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And I said to him, My lord, you know. And he said to me, These are those who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Because of this they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne will tabernacle over them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> They will not hunger anymore, neither will they thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat upon them, nor any heat;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. <br><br>

				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses rushing into war.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to harm men for five months.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon; and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are yet coming after these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they might kill the third part of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the number of the armies of horsemen was two hundred million; I heard their number.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And thus I saw the horses in the vision and those sitting on them, having breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> By these three plagues the third part of the men were killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone proceeding out of their mouths.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they harm men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, still did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship the demons and the idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they did not repent of their murders or of their sorceries or of their fornication or of their thefts. <br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was like the sun, and His feet like pillars of fire;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And He had in His hand a little opened scroll. And He placed His right foot on the sea and the left on the land;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He cried out with a loud voice just as a lion roars. And when He cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of heaven saying, Seal the things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the Angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up His right hand to heaven<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there shall be delay no longer,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the mystery of God is finished, as He has announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the voice which I heard out of heaven, I heard again speaking with me and saying, Go, take the opened scroll in the hand of the Angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And I went to the Angel and told Him to give me the little scroll. And He said to me, Take it and devour it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the Angel and devoured it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the court which is outside the temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And when they have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and will overcome them and kill them.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And after the three and a half days, the breath of life out of God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon. And the dragon warred and his angels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And they did not prevail, neither was their place found any longer in heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Therefore be glad, O heavens and those who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you and has great rage, knowing that he has only a short time.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And to the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the serpent cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed. And the whole earth marveled after the beast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? And who can make war with him?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been purchased from the earth.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And in their mouth no lie was found; they are without blemish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to announce to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And there were lightnings and voices and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not been since man appeared on the earth, such an earthquake, so great.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the Great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And on her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I marveled with great marvel when I saw her.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the beast who was and is not, he himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom but receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For God has put it into their hearts to perform His mind and to perform one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the ripe fruits of your soul’s lust have gone away from you, and all the sumptuous and splendid things have perished from you; and men will find them no more at all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearl;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For in one hour such great wealth has become desolate! And every ship captain and everyone sailing to a place and sailors and all who work on the sea stood afar off<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And they cast dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, by which all those who have ships on the sea became rich from her wealth, for in one hour she has become desolate!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Be glad over her, O heaven and saints and apostles and prophets, because God has judged judgment for you upon her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, Thus will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence and shall be found no more at all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And the sound of harp-singers and musicians and flutists and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in you, and no craftsman of any craft shall be found anymore at all in you, and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in you, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the great ones of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth. <br><br>

			<h4 id="revelation-19">Revelation 19</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And a second time they said, Hallelujah! And her smoke goes up forever and ever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves and those who fear Him, the small and the great.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he said to me, Do not do this. I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He has a name written which no one knows but Himself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come here; gather yourselves to the great dinner of God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> That you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free and slave and small and great.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet, who in his presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh. <br><br>

			<h4 id="revelation-20">Revelation 20</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And cast him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not deceive the nations any longer until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be loosed for a little while.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war. Their number is like that of the sand of the sea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And they went up upon the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city; and fire came down out of heaven and devoured them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened; and another scroll was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the scrolls, according to their works.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, each of them, according to their works.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire. <br><br>

			<h4 id="revelation-21">Revelation 21</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And He said to me, They have come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And its gates shall by no means be shut by day, for there will be no night there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And anything common and he who makes an abomination and a lie shall by no means enter into it, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life. <br><br>

			<h4 id="revelation-22">Revelation 22</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And there will no longer be a curse. And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His slaves will serve Him;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them; and they will reign forever and ever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this scroll.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I John am he who hears and sees these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And he said to me, Do not do that! I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers the prophets and of those who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the time is near.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still; and let him who is righteous do righteousness still; and let him who is holy be holy still.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and makes a lie.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> I Jesus have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright morning star.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this scroll;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And if anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> He who testifies these things says, Yes, I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen. <br><br>
