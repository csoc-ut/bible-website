			<h4 id="ezekiel-1">Ezekiel 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now in the thirtieth year, in the fourth <i>month,</i> on the fifth of the month, while I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> On the fifth of the month (it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity)<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> The word of Jehovah came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was upon him there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I looked, and there came a storm wind from the north, a great cloud and a fire flashing incessantly; and there was a brightness around it, and from the midst of it there was <i>something</i> like the sight of electrum, from the midst of the fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And from the midst of it <i>there came</i> the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like the sight of burnished bronze.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides. And the four of them had their faces and their wings <i>thus:</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Their wings were joined one to another; they did not turn as they went; each went straight forward.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> As for the likeness of their faces, <i>they had</i> the face of a man; and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side, and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four of them had the face of an eagle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And thus their faces were. And their wings were spread out upward; two <i>wings</i> of each were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And each went straight forward; wherever the Spirit was to go, they went; they did not turn as they went.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches; the fire went to and fro among the living creatures, and the fire was bright; and out of the fire went forth lightning.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the living creatures ran to and fro like the appearance of a lightning bolt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And as I watched the living creatures, I saw a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for <i>each of</i> their four faces.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship were like the sight of beryl. And the four of them had one likeness; that is, their appearance and their workmanship were as it were a wheel within a wheel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Whenever they went, they went in their four directions; they did not turn as they went.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> As for their rims, they were high and they were awesome; and the rims of the four of them were full of eyes all around.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And whenever the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and whenever the living creatures were lifted up above the earth, the wheels were lifted up <i>also.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Wherever the Spirit was to go, they went — wherever the Spirit was to go. And the wheels were lifted up alongside them, for the Spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Whenever those went, these went; and whenever those stood still, these stood still; and whenever those were lifted up above the earth, the wheels were lifted up alongside them; for the Spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And over the heads of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like the sight of awesome crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And under the expanse <i>one pair of</i> their wings went straight out, one toward the other; each had <i>another</i> pair covering their bodies on this side and on that side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, as they went; <i>it was</i> the sound of a tumult, like the sound of an army. Whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And there was a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood still, they dropped their wings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, like the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was One in appearance like a man, above it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Then I saw <i>something</i> like the sight of electrum, like the appearance of fire encased all around, from the appearance of His loins and upward; and from the appearance of His loins and downward, I saw <i>something</i> like the appearance of fire. And there was brightness all around Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Like the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud on a day of rain, such was the appearance of the brightness all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw <i>it,</i> I fell on my face and I heard the voice of someone speaking.<br><br>

			<h4 id="ezekiel-2">Ezekiel 2</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then He said to me, Son of man, stand up on your feet, and I will speak with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke to me and caused me to stand up on my feet. And I heard Him who spoke to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to rebellious heathen who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me unto this very day;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And they are impudent and hard-hearted children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they, whether they hear or not — for they are a rebellious house — they will know that a prophet has been in their midst.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them and do not be afraid of their words; though thistles and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions, do not be afraid of their words and do not be dismayed at their faces; for they are a rebellious house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And you shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or not; for they are rebellious.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I give you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And I looked, and there was a hand, put forth toward me; and in it there was a scroll book.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And He spread it before me. And it was written on the front and back, and on it were written lamentations, mourning, and woe.<br><br>

			<h4 id="ezekiel-3">Ezekiel 3</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then He said to me, Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> So I opened my mouth, and He gave me that scroll to eat.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your inward parts with this scroll that I am giving you. And I ate <i>it,</i> and it was like honey in my mouth in <i>its</i> sweetness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then He said to me, Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> For you are being sent not to a people of strange speech and unintelligible language <i>but</i> to the house of Israel,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Not to many peoples of strange speech and unintelligible language, whose words you cannot understand. If I were to send you to such, they would hear you;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But the house of Israel is not willing to hear you, for they are not willing to hear Me, because all the house of Israel is obstinate and stiff-hearted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I am now making your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Like adamant, harder than flint, I am making your forehead; do not be afraid of them or dismayed at their faces, for they are a rebellious house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Moreover He said to me, Son of man, all My words that I will speak to you take into your heart and hear with your ears.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And go to those of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah; whether they hear or not.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great quaking, <i>saying:</i> Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from His place!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And <i>I heard</i> the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another and the sound of the wheels alongside them and the sound of a great quaking.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the Spirit lifted me up and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And I came to those of the captivity at Tel-abib who dwelt by the river Chebar; and where they dwelt, there I sat for seven days in their midst appalled.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And at the end of seven days the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman to the house of Israel, and you will hear the word from My mouth and will give them warnings from Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> When I say to a wicked one, You shall surely die, and you do not warn him nor speak to warn the wicked one from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked one will die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Yet if you warn the wicked one and he does not turn from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he will die for his iniquity and you have delivered your soul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And when a righteous one turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you did not warn him, he will die in his sin, and his righteous actions, which he had done, will not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And if you warn a righteous one so that the righteous one does not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he was warned; and you have delivered your soul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And the hand of Jehovah was upon me there; and He said to me, Arise, go forth to the plain, and there I will speak with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> So I arose and went forth to the plain. And the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then the Spirit entered into me and caused me to stand up on my feet; and He spoke with me and said to me, Go, shut yourself up within your house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> As for you, son of man, they will now put ropes on you and bind you with them so that you cannot go out among them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be dumb and not one who reproves <i>them,</i> for they are a rebellious house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Let him who hears hear, and let him who refuses refuse; for they are a rebellious house.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now you, son of man, take a tile and set it before you; and inscribe on it a city, Jerusalem;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And lay a siege against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it, and set up camps against it, and set battering rams all around it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And take an iron plate and set it as an iron wall between you and the city, and set your face against it; and it will be under siege, and you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Moreover lie down on your left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; you shall bear their iniquity for the number of days that you lie on it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And I have appointed to you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; and you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And when you have completed them, lie down again, on your right side; and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah for forty days; I have appointed to you a day for each year.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then toward the siege of Jerusalem you shall set your face with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I will then put ropes on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, until you have completed the days of your siege.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make them into bread for yourself. For the number of days that you lie on your side, for three-hundred ninety days, you shall eat it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And your food which you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight; at fixed times you shall eat it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the water that you drink shall be a sixth of a hin by measure; at fixed times you shall drink <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And as a barley cake you shall eat it; on human excrement you shall bake it in their sight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Jehovah said, Thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations to which I will drive them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah. Indeed my soul has never been defiled; for from my youth until now I have not eaten anything that has died of itself or has been torn to pieces, nor has any abominable flesh entered into my mouth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He said to me, See, I give you cow’s dung instead of human excrement, and you will make your bread over it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then He said to me, Son of man, I am now breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem; and they will eat bread by weight and in anxiety, and they will drink water by measure and in horror;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Because they will lack bread and water, and they will be horrified at each other and will rot in their iniquity.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And you, son of man, take a sharp sword; take it as a barber’s razor and pass it over your head and over your beard; then take scales to weigh with, and divide the hair.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> One-third you shall burn with fire in the middle of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you shall take a third and strike <i>it</i> with the sword all around the city; and one-third you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw a sword after them.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Indeed I, even I, am against you, and I will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> One-third of you will die by pestilence, and they will be consumed by famine in the midst of you; and one-third will fall by the sword surrounding you; and one-third I will scatter toward all the winds, and I will draw a sword after them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Thus My anger will be spent, and I will cause My wrath to rest upon them, and I will be comforted; and they will know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal when I spend My wrath upon them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that surround you, in the sight of all who pass by.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Thus you will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations that surround you, when I execute judgments upon you in anger and wrath and furious rebukes. I, Jehovah, have spoken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> When I send against them the evil arrows of famine, which are for destruction <i>and</i> which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Thus I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they will make you childless; and pestilence and blood will pass through you, and I will bring a sword upon you. I, Jehovah, have spoken.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah. Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys, I am now bringing a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And your altars will be desolated, and your sun images will be broken; and I will make your slain fall before your idols.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> In all the places that you dwell the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolated, so that your altars may be laid waste and desolated, and your idols may be broken and brought to an end, and your sun images may be cut down, and your works may be blotted out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the slain will fall in your midst, and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But I will leave a remnant, in that you will have those who have escaped the sword among the nations, when you are scattered among the countries.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations to which they are carried away, how I am broken with their heart of harlotry, which turned away from Me, and with their eyes that go as harlots after their idols; and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils that they have done, for all their abominations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they will know that I am Jehovah; I have not said in vain that I would do this ill to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Clap your hands and stamp your foot and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they will fall by sword, famine, and pestilence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> He who is far off will die by the pestilence, and he who is near will fall by the sword, and he who is left remaining and is besieged will die by the famine; thus I will spend My wrath on them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then you will know that I am Jehovah, when their slain are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy terebinth, the places where they offered a sweet savor to all their idols.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> So I will stretch out My hand against them and will make the land desolate, indeed, more desolate than the wilderness of Diblath, in all the places that they dwell; and they will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> An end is coming; the end is coming! It has awakened against you; it has now come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Doom has come to you, you who inhabit the land; the time has come; the day is near — tumult and not the joyful shout on the mountains.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you and spend My anger against you; and I will judge you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Indeed the day — it has now come. Doom has gone forth. The rod has blossomed; pride has budded;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Violence has risen up as a rod of wickedness. Nothing of them <i>remains:</i> nothing of their multitude, nothing of their wealth, and no eminence among them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> The time has come; the day has drawn near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is against all their multitude.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For the seller will not return to what he has sold, while they live among the living; for the vision, which regards all the land’s multitude, will not be turned; not one of them will assure his life by his iniquity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> They have blown the trumpet and have made everything ready, but no one goes to the battle; for My wrath is against all the land’s multitude.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> The sword is outside, and pestilence and famine are inside: He who is in the field will die by the sword, and he who is in the city will be devoured by famine and pestilence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And those of them who escape will escape, and they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each for his iniquity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> All hands will drop, and all knees will melt into water.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And they will gird themselves with sackcloth, and shuddering will cover them; and on all their faces there will be shame, and baldness on all their heads.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Their silver will they cast into the streets, and their gold will be an impurity; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them on the day of Jehovah’s overflowing wrath. They cannot satisfy their souls nor fill their inward parts, for their iniquity has become a stumbling block to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And they turned the beauty of His ornaments into pride; and they made the images of their abominations, of their detestable things, with it; therefore I make it an impurity to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And I will give it into the hands of strangers as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> I will also turn My face from them, and they will profane My secret place; indeed the robbers will enter it and profane it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Make a chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses; and I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places will be profaned.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Anguish comes; and they seek peace, but there is none.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Disaster upon disaster will come, and there will be rumor upon rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with horror, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their ways I will deal with them, and by their judgments I will judge them; and they will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth of the month, as I sat in my house and the elders of Judah sat before me, the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell upon me there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Then I looked, and there was a likeness like the appearance of fire: from His loins and downward, the appearance of fire; and from His loins and upward something like the appearance of brightness, like the sight of electrum.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He stretched out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and heaven and brought me to Jerusalem in the visions of God, to the entrance of the gate of the inner court that faces north, where the seat of the idol of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance that I saw in the plain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then He said to me, Son of man, Lift up your eyes now toward the north. Thus I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and there, toward the north at the altar gate, was this idol of jealousy at the entry.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, that I should be far from My sanctuary? But you will yet see greater abominations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then He brought me to the entrance of the court; and I looked, and there was a hole in the wall.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, dig now through the wall. So I dug through the wall, and there was <i>now</i> an entrance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And He said to me, Go and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Thus I entered and looked, and there were every form of creeping thing and detestable beast and all the idols of the house of Israel, engraved on the wall all around.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And standing before them were seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each with his censer in his hand and the smell of the incense cloud went up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And He said to me, Do you see, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each in the room of his engraved images? For they say, Jehovah does not see us; Jehovah has forsaken the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And He said to me, You will yet again see greater abominations that they are committing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah that was toward the north; and women weeping for Tammuz were sitting there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He said to me, Do you see, son of man? You will yet again see greater abominations than these.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then He brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah; and there, at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And He said to me, Do you see <i>this,</i> son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they <i>also</i> fill the land with violence and again and again provoke Me to anger? And now they are putting the branch to their nose.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Therefore I will also deal <i>with them</i> in wrath. My eye will not pity, nor will I spare; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then He cried out in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Draw near, you who oversee the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And then six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand; and there was one man among them, clothed in linen, with a scribe’s inkhorn by his side. And they went and stood beside the bronze altar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub on which it had been to the threshold of the house. And He called out to the man clothed in linen, who <i>had</i> the scribe’s inkhorn by his side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jehovah said to him, Pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan because of all the abominations that are committed in its midst.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And to the others He said in my hearing, Pass through the city behind him and strike; do not let your eye pity, and do not spare.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Utterly slay the old man <i>and</i> the young man, and the maiden, the little child, and the women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark. And you shall begin at My sanctuary. Thus they began with the elders who were before the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And He said to them, Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain; go forth. And they went forth and struck <i>the people</i> in the city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And as they were striking them and I was left alone, I fell on my face, and I cried out and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Are You destroying the whole remnant of Israel in Your pouring out of Your wrath upon Jerusalem?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And He said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great; and the land is full of blood, and the city, full of perverted justice; for they say, Jehovah has forsaken the land, and Jehovah does not see.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But as for Me, My eye will not pity, nor will I spare; I will bring their ways upon their head.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then I looked, and there, in the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim, appeared the likeness of a throne over them, like the appearance of a sapphire stone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, Go in between the whirling wheels, under the cherub, and fill the hollow of your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter <i>them</i> over the city. And he went in, in my sight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the glory of Jehovah rose up from the cherub to <i>a place</i> above the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of the Almighty God when He speaks.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And when He had commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, the man went and stood beside the wheel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim toward the fire that was between the cherubim, and he took some up and put <i>it</i> into the hands of the man clothed in linen; and the man took <i>it</i> and went forth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And with the cherubim appeared the form of a man’s hand under their wings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like the sight of beryl.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And as for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, as it were a wheel within a wheel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> As they went, they went in their four directions; they did not turn as they went, but to the place that the head faced they followed; they did not turn as they went.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And their whole body, their backs, their hands, and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around, their wheels <i>belonging</i> to the four of them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> The wheels were called in my hearing the whirling wheels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And every one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub; the second face was the face of a man; the third, the face of a lion; and the fourth, the face of an eagle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then the cherubim rose up. This was the living creature that I had seen by the river Chebar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And whenever the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and whenever the cherubim lifted their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn from beside them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> When those stood still, these stood still; and when those rose up, these rose up with them; for the Spirit of the living creature was in them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the cherubim lifted their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels were next to them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> This was the living creature that I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings; and the likeness of a man’s hands was under their wings.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give evil counsel in this city,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> The city will not be a pot to you so that you will be in its midst as flesh; I will judge you in the borders of Israel.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Son of man, your brothers, your brothers, your kinsmen and the whole house of Israel, all of them, are the ones to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Stay far away from Jehovah; to us was this land given as an inheritance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Though I have sent them far away among the nations and though I have scattered them among the countries, I have been a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries where they went.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries among which you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And they will come there and take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them; and I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their ways upon their heads, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were next to them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, you are dwelling in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see <i>and</i> have ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Therefore you, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for captivity, and go into captivity by day in their sight; indeed you shall go into captivity from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will see that they are a rebellious house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And you shall bring your baggage forth by day in their sight like baggage for captivity, and you shall go forth in the evening in their sight as captives go forth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> In their sight you shall dig through the wall and bring <i>your baggage</i> through it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> In their sight you shall take <i>it</i> up on <i>your</i> shoulder; in the dark you shall bring <i>it</i> forth. You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the ground, for I have given you as a sign to the house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And I did as I was commanded: I brought forth my baggage by day like baggage for captivity, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand; in the dark I brought forth <i>the baggage;</i> on <i>my</i> shoulder I took <i>it</i> up in their sight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me in the morning, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What are you doing?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, This burden <i>pertains</i> to the prince in Jerusalem and to all the house of Israel, which is in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Say, I am a sign of you. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the prince who is in their midst will take up <i>his baggage</i> on <i>his</i> shoulder in the dark and will go forth; they will dig through the wall in order to bring <i>his baggage</i> forth through it; he will hide his face so that he does not see the land with <i>his</i> eyes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I will also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare; and I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he will not see it and will die there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And all who surround him to help him and all his armies, I will scatter into every wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And they will know that I am Jehovah, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the countries.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But I will keep a small number of men from among them from sword, from famine, and from pestilence that they may recount all their abominations among the nations to which they go; and they will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with quivering and anxious carefulness;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel, They will eat their bread with anxious carefulness and drink their water with horror so that their land may be emptied of its fullness because of the violence of all who dwell in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the inhabited cities will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation; and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Son of man, what is this proverb that you <i>all</i> have concerning the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged and every vision fails?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will bring this proverb to an end, so that they will no longer have the proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days have drawn near as well as the fulfillment of every vision.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> For there will no longer be vain vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> For it is I, Jehovah, who speaks; whatever word I speak will be performed; it will no longer be delayed; for in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak a word and I will perform it, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And <i>again</i> the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Son of man, the house of Israel now says, The vision that he sees pertains to <i>things</i> many days <i>from now,</i> and he prophesies concerning distant times.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, No words of Mine will be delayed any longer, but the word that I have spoken will be performed, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Your prophets, O Israel, have become like foxes among ruins.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> You have not gone up to the breaches nor built up the wall for the house of Israel that it might stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> They have seen vanity and deceptive divination, they who say, Jehovah declares! when Jehovah has not sent them; but they expect that He will fulfill <i>their</i> word.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Have you not seen a vain vision and spoken deceptive divination when you say, Jehovah declares! and I have not spoken?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you have spoken vanity and have seen deceptive visions, therefore I am now against you, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And My hand will be upon the prophets who see vanity and perform deceptive divination; they shall not be in the council of My people, nor shall they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you will know that I am the Lord Jehovah;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Because, indeed because, they have led My people astray, saying, Peace, when there is no peace; but it is <i>as if</i> someone builds up a wall, and immediately they plaster it over with untempered mortar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Tell those who plaster over with untempered mortar that it will fall. There will be a flooding rain; and you, O hailstones, will fall; and a tempestuous wind will break <i>it</i> down.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Indeed when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, Where is the plaster with which you plastered <i>it?</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will cause a tempestuous wind to break forth in My wrath, and there will be a flooding rain in My anger, and hailstones to consume <i>it</i> in wrath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And I will tear down the wall that you plastered over with untempered mortar and will tear it down to the ground, so that its foundation is uncovered; and it will fall, and you will be consumed in the midst of it; and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And I will spend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it over with untempered mortar; and I will say to you, The wall is not there, and those who plaster it over are not there,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> The prophets of Israel, who prophesy concerning Jerusalem and see visions of peace for her, when there is no peace, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And you, son of man, set your face toward the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their heart, and prophesy against them<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the women who sew bands on all the wrists and make caps for the heads <i>of persons</i> of every stature, so as to hunt down souls! Will you hunt down the souls of My people while you preserve alive the souls <i>of others</i> for yourselves?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And you have profaned Me before My people for some handfuls of barley and for some pieces of bread by putting to death some people who should not die and preserving alive other people who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to your lies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am now against your bands with which you hunt down souls there as <i>you would</i> birds; and I will tear them off your arms and will release the souls, which souls you hunt down as <i>you would</i> birds.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> I will also tear off your caps and will deliver My people from your hand, and they will no longer be in your hand to be hunted down; and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Because you discouraged the heart of the righteous man with lies, though I Myself did not pain him, and strengthened the hands of the wicked man so that he would not turn from his evil way and you would cause him to live,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Therefore you will no <i>longer</i> see vanity and you will no longer practice divination, but I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Each and every man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and goes to the prophet, I, Jehovah, will be found to be answering according to this, according to the multitude of his idols;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> That I may lay hold of the house of Israel in their heart, who have become estranged from Me because of all their idols.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Repent, and turn away from your idols; and turn your faces away from all your abominations;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I will set My face against that man, and I will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But if the prophet is enticed to speak a word, I, Jehovah, have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of My people Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they will bear their iniquity: As the iniquity of the prophet is, so the iniquity of him who inquires <i>of him</i> shall be,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in the midst of it, they would deliver <i>only</i> their own souls by their righteousness, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> If I were to cause wild beasts to pass through the land so that they destroyed its inhabitants and it became so desolate that no one would pass through <i>it</i> because of the beasts,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> <i>Though</i> these three men were in the midst of it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they could not deliver <i>even their</i> sons and daughters; they alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Or <i>if</i> I were to bring a sword upon that land and were to say, Let a sword pass through the land, and I were to cut off man and beast from it;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Though these three men were in the midst of it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they could not deliver <i>even their</i> sons and daughters, but they alone would be delivered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Or <i>if</i> I were to send pestilence into that land and were to pour out My wrath upon it in blood so as to cut off man and beast from it,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in the midst of it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they could not deliver <i>even</i> a son or daughter; they would deliver <i>only</i> their own souls by their righteousness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, How much more then when I send My four severe judgments upon Jerusalem, sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence, to cut off man and beast from it!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Yet there will be a remnant left in it that will be brought forth, <i>both</i> sons and daughters.

				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And I will set My face against them: They have gone forth from the fire, yet the fire will consume them; and you will know that I am Jehovah when I set My face against them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem, Your origin and your birth are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> As for your birth, on the day that you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling clothes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> No eye pitied you <i>enough</i> to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown into the open field because you were loathed on the day that you were born.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I passed by you and saw you kicking about in your blood, and I said to you <i>while you were</i> in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to you <i>while you were</i> in your blood, Live!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> I caused you to increase like the sprouts of the field; and you increased and grew big, and you came to full beauty; <i>your</i> breasts became firm and your hair grew; but you were naked and bare.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then I passed by you and saw you; and then was your time a time of love. And I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness; indeed I swore unto you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord Jehovah, and you became Mine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then I washed you with water; yes, I washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> I also clothed you with an embroidered garment and put sandals of porpoise skin on you, and I bound <i>your head</i> with fine linen and covered you with silk.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your wrists and a necklace around your neck;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And I put a ring in your nose and earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was fine linen and silk and embroidery; you ate fine flour and honey and oil. And you became so very beautiful, and you prospered so as to become royalty.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect because of My splendor, which I had put upon you, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But you trusted in your beauty and went about as a harlot because of your renown, and you poured out your fornications upon everyone who passed by; <i>your beauty</i> became his.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you took some of your garments and made high places of varied colors for yourself, and you committed fornication upon them, things that had never happened <i>before,</i> nor should have been.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And you took your beautiful articles, <i>made</i> of My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made images of men for yourself and committed fornication with them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you took your garments of embroidery and covered them, and you offered My oil and My incense before them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And My bread, which I had given you, the fine flour and oil and honey that I fed you with, you offered before them as a sweet savor; thus it was, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Moreover you took your sons and daughters, whom you had borne unto Me, and you sacrificed them to those <i>idols</i> to be devoured. Were your fornications a small matter,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> That you slaughtered My children and delivered them up to pass through <i>fire</i> unto those <i>idols?</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And in all your abominations and fornications you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare <i>and</i> you were kicking about in your blood.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then after all your wickedness (Woe, woe to you! declares the Lord Jehovah)<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> You built yourself a mound and made yourself an elevation in every open square.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> At the head of every street you built your elevation and caused your beauty to be abhorred; and you spread your legs to everyone who passed by and multiplied your fornications.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> You also committed fornication with the sons of Egypt, your neighbors, great of flesh, and multiplied your fornications to provoke Me to anger.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Indeed then I stretched out My hand over you and diminished the food apportioned to you; and I delivered you to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> You also committed fornication with the sons of Assyria because you were not satisfied; and you committed fornication with them and were still not satisfied.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Furthermore you multiplied your fornications into the land of merchants, Chaldea, yet you were still not satisfied by this.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> How feeble is your heart, declares the Lord Jehovah, in that you do all these things, the actions of an unrestrained harlot!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> When you built your mound at the head of every street and you made your elevation in every open square, you were not like a harlot, by disdaining payment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> The adulterous wife takes strangers instead of her husband.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Men give gifts to all harlots, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers and bribed them to come to you from all around for your fornications.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Thus you are perverse compared to <i>other</i> women in your fornications, in that they do not go after you as a prostitute, but you give payment and no payment is given to you; therefore you are perverse.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> Therefore, you harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness was uncovered through your fornications with your lovers and with all your abominable idols and because of the blood of your children, whom you gave to them,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> Therefore I am about to gather all your lovers whom you have pleased, indeed, all those whom you loved, with all those whom you hated; thus I will gather them against you from all around, and I will uncover your nakedness to them so that they may see all your nakedness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And I will judge you with the judgment <i>that falls</i> on adulterous women and on women who shed blood, and I will bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And I will give you into their hand; and they will tear down your mounds and break down your elevations; they will also strip you of your garments and take your beautiful articles, and they will leave you naked and bare.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And they will raise up a crowd against you and will stone you with stones and will cut you to pieces with their swords.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> And they will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women. And I will stop you from being a harlot, and also you will no longer give payment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> Thus I will cause My wrath against you to rest, and My jealousy will turn from you; and I will be quiet and angry no more.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> Because you have not remembered the days of your youth but have raged against Me in all these things, therefore, I, for My part, will bring your ways upon <i>your</i> head, declares the Lord Jehovah; and you will not commit this lewdness in addition to all your abominations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> Indeed everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb concerning you, saying, As the mother is, so is her daughter.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> You are the daughter of your mother, she who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, they who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father was an Amorite.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And your older sister is Samaria with her daughters, who lives to your left; and your sister who is younger than you, who lives to your right, is Sodom with her daughters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> But you have not walked <i>merely</i> according to their ways and have not acted <i>merely</i> according to their abominations; but, as if such were too small a thing, you acted more corruptly in all your ways than they did.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, Sodom your sister, she with her daughters, has not done as you have done, you with your daughters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> Indeed this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, abundance of bread, and careless ease were with her and her daughters, but she did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me. Therefore I took them away when I saw <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> And Samaria has not committed the half of your sins, but you have multiplied your abominations more than they and have justified your sisters in all your abominations which you have committed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>52</b></sup> Bear then also your disgrace, which you have adjudged to your sisters; through your sins which you have committed more abominably than they, they are more righteous than you; indeed then be also put to shame and bear your disgrace, in that you have made your sisters <i>appear to</i> be more righteous.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>53</b></sup> But I will turn their captivity, the captivity of Sodom with her daughters and the captivity of Samaria with her daughters, as well as the captivity of your captives with them;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>54</b></sup> That you may bear your disgrace and be disgraced for all that you have done, in that you were a comfort to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>55</b></sup> And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters, will return to their former state, and Samaria with her daughters will return to their former state; and you with your daughters will return to your former state.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>56</b></sup> Indeed, was not Sodom your sister a byword in your mouth on the day of your pride,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>57</b></sup> Before your wickedness was uncovered? So now <i>you are</i> the reproach of the daughters of Aram and all who are around her <i>and</i> of the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who despise you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>58</b></sup> You have borne your own lewdness and abominations, declares Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>59</b></sup> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will also do with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>60</b></sup> Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an eternal covenant for you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>61</b></sup> Then you will remember your ways and you will be disgraced when you receive your sisters, the ones older than you and the ones younger than you; and I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>62</b></sup> And I will establish My covenant with you, and you will know that I am Jehovah,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>63</b></sup> That you may remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth because of your disgrace, when I make propitiation for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

			<h4 id="ezekiel-17">Ezekiel 17</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, put forth a riddle, and utter a parable to the house of Israel;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, A great eagle with great wings, long pinions, <i>and</i> full plumage of many colors came to Lebanon and took away the top of the cedar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> He cropped off its topmost young twig and brought it to a land of merchants; he set it in a city of traders.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> He also took some of the seed of the land and put it in a fertile field; he took <i>it and</i> set it by abundant waters like a willow,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> That it might sprout and become a low, running vine with its branches turned toward him and its roots under him. And it became a vine and produced offshoots and sent forth boughs.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and then this vine bent its roots toward him, and from the beds where it was planted it sent out its branches toward him that he might water it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> In a good field by abundant waters it had been transplanted so that it would produce branches and bear fruit, that it might be a magnificent vine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Say <i>then,</i> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit so that it withers? All its fresh sprouting leaves will wither, even without great strength or a mighty people pulling it up from its roots.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And indeed, though it has been transplanted, will it thrive? Will it not wither completely once the east wind touches it? In the beds where it was planted it will wither.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things <i>mean?</i> Say, Indeed the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and he took its king and its rulers and brought them to him at Babylon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he took someone of the royal seed and made a covenant with him and put him under an oath. He also took the mighty men of the land,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> That the kingdom might be humble, that it might not lift itself up, <i>but</i> by keeping his covenant, it might stand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But he rebelled against him by sending his messengers to Egypt that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does these things escape? Can he break the covenant and slip away?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely in the land of the king who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, with him in the midst of Babylon he will die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Pharaoh with <i>his</i> mighty army and great company will not aid him in battle, when they cast up mounds and build siegeworks to cut off many lives.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Indeed, he despised the oath by breaking the covenant; yes, he even gave his hand and yet did all these things; he will not slip away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, As I live, surely My oath, which he despised, and My covenant, which he broke, I will bring upon his head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare; and I will bring him to Babylon and will enter into judgment with him there concerning his unfaithfulness by which he has been unfaithful to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And all his choice men with all his armies will fall by the sword, and those who are left will be scattered into every wind; and you will know that I, Jehovah, have spoken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will also take a <i>twig</i> from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out; from the topmost of its young twigs I will crop off a tender one, and I will transplant <i>it</i> upon a high and prominent mountain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> On the high mountain of Israel I will transplant it; and it will bear branches and produce fruit and will become a magnificent cedar; and under it all birds of every kind will nest; in the shade of its branches they will nest.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And all the trees of the field will know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the exalted tree and have exalted the lowly tree, <i>that</i> I have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree bud. I, Jehovah, have spoken, and I will do it.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers eat sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, the use of this parable will no longer be with you in Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Indeed all souls are Mine; indeed as is the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins, he shall die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and does not defile his neighbor’s wife or come near a menstruous woman;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And if a man does not oppress anyone but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not plunder but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> <i>If</i> he does not lend with interest or collect with an increase; <i>if</i> he withdraws his hand from iniquity <i>and</i> exercises true justice between man and man;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> <i>If</i> he walks in My statutes and keeps My ordinances to do truth — he is righteous; he shall surely live, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But if he begets a violent son, one who sheds blood or does only one of these things<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> (Though he himself has done none of these things); if he even eats upon the mountains or defiles his neighbor’s wife,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Oppresses the poor and needy, commits plunder, does not restore the pledge, or lifts his eyes to the idols <i>and</i> commits abomination,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Lends with interest or collects with an increase; then will he live? He shall not live. He has committed all these abominations; he shall surely die. His blood shall be upon him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But if he begets a son, and the son sees all the sins of his father that he has done, and he sees and does not do the like;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> He does not eat upon the mountains and does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Does not oppress anyone, does not keep the pledge and does not plunder, <i>but</i> gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Takes his hand off the poor and does not collect with interest or increase, does My ordinances <i>and</i> walks in My statutes; he shall not die for his father’s iniquity; he shall surely live.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> As for his father, because he practiced extortion, plundered <i>his</i> brother, and did that which was not good in the midst of his people, indeed he shall die for his iniquity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Yet you say, Why? Does not the son share <i>the punishment for</i> the father’s iniquity? When the son has practiced justice and righteousness <i>and</i> has kept all My statutes and done them, he shall surely live.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The soul who sins, he shall die; the son shall not share <i>the punishment for</i> the father’s iniquity, nor shall the father share <i>the punishment for</i> the son’s iniquity. The righteousness of the righteous man shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked man shall be upon him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> But if the wicked man turns from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; because of his righteousness that he has practiced he shall live.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Do I take pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord Jehovah, <i>and</i> not in his turning away from his ways that he may live?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> But when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity <i>and</i> commits all the abominations that the wicked man commits, will he live? None of his righteousness that he has practiced shall be remembered. Because of his unfaithfulness in which he has acted unfaithfully and because of his sin which he has sinned, because of them, he shall die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not fair. Hear now, O house of Israel! Is My way not fair? Is it not your ways that are not fair?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> When a righteous man turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity and dies as a consequence, because of his iniquity that he has practiced he shall die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Again, when a wicked man turns from his wickedness that he has practiced and practices justice and righteousness, he shall save his life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Because he sees and turns from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Yet the house of Israel says, The way of the Lord is not fair. Are My ways not fair, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are not fair?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his ways, declares the Lord Jehovah. Repent, and turn away from all your transgressions so that iniquity will not become a stumbling block to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Cast away from you all your transgressions by which you have transgressed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> For I take no pleasure in the death of him who dies, declares the Lord Jehovah; therefore turn and live.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and they sat before me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Have you come to inquire of Me? As I live, I will not be inquired of by you, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Will you judge them, will you judge, son of man? Make them know the abominations of their fathers,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, On the day when I chose Israel and lifted up My hand to the seed of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt; when I lifted up My hand to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> On that day I lifted up My hand to them to bring them out of the land of Egypt to a land that I had spied out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all the lands.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But I did <i>something</i> for My name’s sake that it might not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in the midst of whom they were, in whose sight I had made Myself known to them in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore I caused them to go forth from the land of Egypt, and I brought them into the wilderness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And I gave them My statutes and made known to them My ordinances, by which, if a man does them, he will live.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Because they rejected My ordinances and did not walk in My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths, for their heart went after idols.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> But My eye pitied them, so that I did not destroy them, and I did not bring them to their end in the wilderness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances, and do not defile yourselves with their idols.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> I also lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and would disperse them among the countries,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Because they did not do My ordinances, but rejected My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were directed to the idols of their fathers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they would not live,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And I declared them unclean because of their gifts, in that they caused everything that opens the womb to pass through <i>fire,</i> that I might make them desolate so that they would know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Still yet in this your fathers blasphemed Me by acting unfaithfully against Me:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> When I had brought them into the land which I had lifted up My hand to give them, they saw every high hill and every leafy tree; and there they offered their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering, and there they made their sweet savor, and there they poured out their drink offerings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Then I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? Therefore the name of it is called Bamah to this day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Do you defile yourselves in the way of your fathers? And do you go about as a harlot after their detestable things?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And when you offer up your gifts, when you make your children pass through fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols until today. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And that which comes up in your spirit shall by no means occur, that which you say, We will be like the nations, like the families of the countries, serving wood and stone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out I will rule over you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And I will bring you out from the peoples and will gather you from the countries among which you have been scattered, with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and I will enter into judgment with you there face to face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And I will cause you to pass under the rod and will bring you into the bond of the covenant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out from the land of their sojourning, but not one will enter into the land of Israel. Thus you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah, Go, serve every one his idols; but afterward, you shall surely listen to Me, and My holy name you will no longer profane with your gifts and with your idols.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> For on My holy mountain, on the mountain of the height of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah, there will the whole house of Israel, all of them, serve Me in the land; there will I accept them and there will I require your contributions and the firstfruits of your offerings with all your holy things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> As a sweet savor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the countries among which you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And you will know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land concerning which I lifted up My hand to give to your fathers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> And there you will remember your ways and all your doings by which you defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have done.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And you will know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for My name’s sake, not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> Son of man, set your face toward Teman, and utter <i>something</i> against the south and prophesy against the forest field of the Negev;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And say to the forest of the Negev, Hear the word of Jehovah: Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am now kindling a fire in you, and it will consume in you every tender tree and every dry tree; the flaming flame will not be quenched, and every surface will be scorched by it, from the south to the north.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> And all flesh will see that I, Jehovah, kindled it; it will not be quenched.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! They say of me, Does he not <i>just</i> use parables?<br><br>

			<h4 id="ezekiel-21">Ezekiel 21</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and utter <i>something</i> against the holy places and prophesy against the land of Israel;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And say to the land of Israel, Thus says Jehovah, I am now against you, and I will draw My sword out of its sheath, and I will cut off from you the righteous man and the wicked.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Because I will cut off from you the righteous man and the wicked, therefore My sword will go forth out of its sheath against all flesh, from the south to the north.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And all flesh will know that I, Jehovah, have drawn My sword out of its sheath; it will not return again.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But you, son of man, groan! With the shaking of loins and with bitterness groan in their sight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And when they say to you, Why do you groan, you shall say, Because of the report that comes; and every heart will melt and every hand will be feeble and every spirit will faint and every knee will flow into water. It is about to come and it will happen, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also polished.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> It is sharpened to slaughter utterly, polished to flash like lightning. Or shall we rejoice, <i>saying,</i> The scepter of my son despises all <i>other</i> wood?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And it is given to be polished, that it may be wielded in the hand. The sword — it is sharpened and it is polished, that it may be given into the hand of the slayer.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Cry out and howl, son of man, for it will come against My people. It will come against all the princes of Israel; they are cast at the sword with My people; therefore strike <i>your</i> thigh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For a trial has been made. And what if even the scepter that despises is no more? declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> You therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap <i>your</i> hands together; and let the sword be doubled a third time, the sword for the slain; it is the sword for a great slain one that encircles them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> In order that hearts may fail and that occasions of falling may multiply at all their gates, I have given the slaughtering sword. Ah! It has been made to flash like lightning; it is drawn for slaying.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Gather yourself up, <i>go</i> to the right; set yourself, <i>go</i> to the left, to wherever your edge is appointed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And I, even I, will clap My hands together and will cause My wrath to rest; I, Jehovah, have spoken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And you, son of man, appoint two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; out of one land both will come. And make a signpost; make <i>it</i> at the fork in the road to <i>each</i> city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> You shall appoint a way for the sword to come, <i>either</i> to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, or to fortified Jerusalem in Judah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the fork in the two roads, using divination; he shakes <i>his</i> arrows, he inquires of the teraphim, he observes the liver.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Into his right hand came the divination for Jerusalem, to set up the battering ram, to open <i>his</i> mouth in killing, to lift up <i>his</i> voice with a shout, to set the battering rams against the gates, to cast up a mound, to build a siege wall.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Yet to those <i>in Jerusalem</i> it will be as a false divination in their sight, to those who have sworn solemn oaths; but He brings the iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear, because you have come to remembrance, you will be taken with the hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you, profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come at the time of the iniquity of the end,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Remove the turban, and take off the crown; what is will not be. Exalt the lowly, and lay low the exalted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Ruins, ruins, ruins will I make it; and this also will be no more, until He comes whose right it is; and I will give it <i>to Him.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon and concerning their reproach; and say, A sword, a sword, drawn for the slaughter, polished to consume, that it may flash like lightning —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> While they see vanity for you, while they divine deception for you — to bring you down upon the necks of the wicked slain, whose day has come at the time of the iniquity of the end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Return <i>it</i> to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And I will pour out My indignation upon you; with the fire of My overflowing wrath I will blow against you, and I will give you into the hand of brutal men, skilled in destruction.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land; you will not be remembered; for I, Jehovah, have spoken.<br><br>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="ezekiel-22">Ezekiel 22</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Now you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Therefore make her know all her abominations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you shall say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, A city that sheds blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that makes idols, against her <i>own good,</i> that she may defile herself!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> You are guilty for the blood which you have shed and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made; and you have caused your days to draw near and have come to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the countries.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Those who are near and those who are far off from you will mock you, who are ill-reputed <i>and</i> in great tumult.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Indeed the princes of Israel, each according to his power, were within you to shed blood.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> They have lightly esteemed father and mother within you; they have treated the stranger with oppression in the midst of you, and the orphan and the widow they have ill-treated within you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> You have despised My holy things and have profaned My Sabbaths.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Slanderous men are within you in order to shed blood, and within you they have eaten upon the mountains; in the midst of you they have committed lewdness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> In you they have uncovered the nakedness of <i>their</i> father; they have humbled women in their uncleanness within you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And one has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife, and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law, and another has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter, within you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Within you they have taken bribes in order to shed blood; you have taken interest and increase and have wrested unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion and have forgotten Me, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Therefore I have now struck My hand against your wrested unjust gain which you have made and at the bloodshed which is in the midst of you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days when I will deal with you? I, Jehovah, have spoken, and I will do <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you among the countries, and I will consume your uncleanness from you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you will be profaned through yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because all of you have become dross, therefore I am now gathering you into the midst of Jerusalem.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow fire upon it <i>and</i> smelt <i>it,</i> so will I gather <i>you</i> in My anger and in My wrath; and I will lay <i>you there</i> and smelt you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Yes, I will gather you and blow upon you with the fire of My overflowing wrath, and you will be smelted in the midst of it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> As silver is smelted in the midst of the furnace, so will you be smelted in the midst of it; and you will know that I, Jehovah, have poured out My wrath upon you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her, like a roaring lion taking prey: They have devoured souls; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have increased <i>the number of</i> her widows in the midst of her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the profane, nor have they made <i>the difference</i> known between the unclean and the clean; and from My Sabbaths they have hidden their eyes; and I am profaned in the midst of them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Her rulers within her are like wolves taking prey, by shedding blood <i>and</i> destroying souls in order to wrest unjust gain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And her prophets have plastered over <i>their deeds</i> with untempered mortar for them, seeing vanity and performing deceptive divination for them, saying, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah has not spoken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> The people of the land have practiced extortion and have committed plunder and have oppressed the poor and needy and have mistreated the stranger without justice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And I sought a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the breach before Me for the sake of the land so that I would not destroy it, but I found no one.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Therefore I have poured out My indignation upon them; in the fire of My overflowing wrath I have consumed them; I have brought their own way upon their heads, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

			<h4 id="ezekiel-23">Ezekiel 23</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And they committed fornication in Egypt; in their youth they committed fornication; there their breasts were pressed, and there their virgin bosoms were handled.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And their names were Oholah, the older one, and Oholibah, her sister; and they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Oholah committed fornication instead of <i>remaining with</i> Me, and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, who were close <i>to her,</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding horses.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And she bestowed her fornication upon them, all of them the choice men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols, she defiled herself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And she did not abandon her fornication from <i>her time in</i> Egypt; for in her youth they had lain with her, and they had handled her virgin bosom, and they had poured out their fornication upon her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians whom she lusted after.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and daughters, and they slew her with the sword. And she became a byword among women, and they executed judgments upon her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And her sister Oholibah saw <i>this,</i> but she was more corrupt in her lust than she and <i>more corrupt</i> in her fornication than the fornication of her sister.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, who were close <i>to her,</i> clothed splendidly, horsemen riding horses, all of them desirable young men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then I saw that she was defiled. Both had taken the same way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And she increased her fornication: When she saw men portrayed upon the wall, images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Girded with belts upon their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their birth;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> She lusted after them, her eyes seeing <i>them;</i> and she sent messengers to them in Chaldea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the Babylonians came to her at the bed of love and defiled her with their fornication. And when she had been defiled by them, her desire for them departed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Thus she uncovered her fornication and she uncovered her nakedness, and My desire for her departed, as My desire for her sister had departed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Yet she multiplied her fornication by recalling the days of her youth, when she committed fornication in the land of Egypt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is <i>like</i> the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is <i>like</i> the issue of horses.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Thus you sought after the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of the breasts of your youth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am now rousing your lovers against you, from whom your desire departed, and am bringing them against you from all around:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> The Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and officials all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And they will come against you with weapons, chariots and wheels, and with a company of peoples; they will set shield and buckler and helmet against you all around. And I will set judgment before them, and they will judge you according to their judgments.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And I will set My jealousy against you that they may deal with you in wrath; they will remove your nose and your ears, and your residue will fall by the sword; they will take your sons and your daughters, and they will consume your residue with fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> They will also strip you of your garments and take your beautiful articles.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and to your fornication <i>brought</i> from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am now giving you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those from whom your desire has departed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And they will deal with you in hatred and will take all that you have gained; and they will abandon you, naked and bare, and the nakedness of your fornication will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your fornication.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> These things will be done to you because you have gone after the nations as a harlot, because you have defiled yourself with their idols.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah,You will drink your sister’s cup, / Deep and wide; / You will be a laughingstock and a mockery; / It contains much.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, / The cup of horror and desolation, / The cup of your sister Samaria.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And you will drink it and drain <i>it</i> / And gnaw at its shards; / And you will tear out your breasts; / For I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you have forgotten Me and have cast Me behind your back, bear now as well your lewdness and your fornication.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare their abominations to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; indeed they have committed adultery with their idols and have also caused their children, whom they bore unto Me, to pass through <i>fire</i> to their idols, to be devoured.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> Moreover they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and have profaned My Sabbaths.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> For when they slaughtered their children to their idols, they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and they have even done this in the midst of My house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> Furthermore, they sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and indeed they came; for them you bathed, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> And you sat upon a splendid bed with a table prepared before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And the sound of a multitude without care was with her; and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with people of the common sort, who put bracelets upon the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries, Will they now commit fornication with her when she is <i>thus?</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> But they went in to her as they would to a woman who is a harlot; thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> And righteous men, they will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, Bring up a company against them, and give them up to terror and plunder.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And the company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> Thus I will cause lewdness to cease from the land, that all women may be admonished not to conduct themselves in the way of your lewdness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> And they will bring your lewdness upon you, and you will bear the sins of <i>having</i> your idols, and you will know that I am the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="ezekiel-24">Ezekiel 24</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, / Put on a pot — put <i>it</i> on; / And also pour water into it;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Gather into it its pieces, / Every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; / Fill <i>it</i> with choice bones.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Take the choice of the flock, / And also <i>put</i> a pile of wood under it; / Bring it to a vigorous boil; / Indeed let its bones be boiled in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the bloody city, to the pot in which there is rust and whose rust has not gone out of it! Take <i>its pieces</i> out of it piece by piece; no lot has fallen upon it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> For her blood was within her; she put it on a bare rock; she did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> In order to stir up wrath, to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon a bare rock, so that it might not be covered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the bloody city! I will also make the pile great.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Heap on the wood, light the fire, boil the meat well, and mix in spices, and let the bones be burned.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then stand it empty upon its coals, so that it may get hot and its bronze may glow, so that its filthiness may be burned away in it <i>and</i> its rust may be consumed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> She has wearied <i>herself</i> with toil, yet her great rust has not gone out of her. <i>Let</i> her rust <i>be</i> in the fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Because of your lewd filthiness — because I tried to cleanse you, but you did not get clean, you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness anymore, until I have caused My wrath toward you to rest.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> I, Jehovah, have spoken. <i>The time</i> is coming, and I will do <i>it;</i> I will not refrain, nor will I spare, nor will I repent. According to your ways and according to your doings I will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Son of man, I am about to take away the delight of your eyes from you with a blow. Yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Groan silently; make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban upon you, and put your sandals upon your feet, and do not cover <i>your</i> lips, and do not eat the bread of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And in the morning I did as I was commanded.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things you are doing <i>signify</i> to us?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> So I said to them, The word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will profane My sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, and that which your soul longs after; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And you will do as I have done; you shall not cover <i>your</i> lips, nor shall you eat the bread of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And your turbans shall be upon your heads, and your sandals, upon your feet; you shall not mourn nor weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan one to another.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you. You shall do just as all he has done. And when it comes, you will know that I am the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> As for you, son of man, surely on the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and what they have set their heart on, their sons and their daughters,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> On that day one who has escaped will come to you to report <i>it</i> in your ears.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> On that day your mouth will be opened to the one who has escaped, and you shall speak and no longer be dumb. So you shall become a sign to them, and they will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, set your face against the children of Ammon and prophesy concerning them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you shall say to the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you said, Aha! against My sanctuary when it was desecrated, and against the land of Israel when it was desolated, and against the house of Judah when it went off into exile;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Therefore I am about to deliver you up to the children of the east to be dispossessed, and they will set up their encampments among you and put their dwellings among you. It is they who will eat your fruit and drink your milk.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And I will make Rabbah pasture land for camels and <i>the cities</i> of the children of Ammon folds for flocks, and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you have clapped <i>your</i> hands and stamped <i>your</i> feet and rejoiced with all the malice within you against the land of Israel,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Therefore now I have stretched out My hand against you, and I will deliver you as booty to the nations and cut you off from the peoples and destroy you from the lands; I will destroy you that you may know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because Moab has said, Look, the house of Judah is just like all the <i>other</i> nations!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore I am about to open up the flank of Moab, <i>taking</i> cities from the cities on its frontier, the pride of the land, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, even to Kiriathaim.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> I will also deliver it along with the children of Ammon to the children of the east to be dispossessed, so that the children of Ammon might not be remembered among the nations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> So I will execute judgments against Moab that they may know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because the Philistines have acted in vengeance and have been full of vengeance <i>acting</i> with malice within them to destroy with a perpetual enmity,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am about to stretch out My hand against the Philistines and cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seashore.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: How the coastlands will shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when slaughter occurs in your midst!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground and tremble every moment and be astonished at you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And they will take up a lamentation over you and say to you,How you have perished, O inhabited one, / From the sea, O praised city, / Which was strong by the sea, / She and her inhabitants, / Who imposed their terror on all her inhabitants!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Now the coastlands will tremble / On the day of your fall; / The coastlands which are by the sea / Will indeed be troubled because of your departure.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient waste places, with those who go down to the pit, so you will not be inhabited, nor shine out glory in the land of the living.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Indeed you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret hidden from you;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> By your wisdom and by your understanding you have made your wealth and accumulated gold and silver in your treasuries.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you have set your heart as <i>if it were</i> the heart of God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Therefore I am about to bring strangers upon you, the most ruthless of the nations; and they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they will defile your splendor.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> You were the anointed cherub who covered <i>the</i> <i>Ark;</i> indeed I set you, <i>so that</i> you were upon the holy mountain of God; you walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned. So I cast you out as profane from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness. I cast you to the ground; I presented you before kings that they may look at you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> By the multitude of your iniquities in the unrighteousness of your trading you have profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I sent forth fire from your midst; it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all those who look at you.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Indeed Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon / With beautiful branches and forest shade / And great height, / And its top shoots were among the thick boughs.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Waters nourished it, / The deep <i>springs</i> made it grow; / Its rivers flowed around / The place it was planted; / And it flowed out its channels / To all the trees of the field.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Therefore its height was exalted / Above all the trees of the field, / And its boughs were multiplied, / And its branches lengthened, / Because of abundant waters, as it spread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> All the birds of the sky / Made their nests in its boughs, / And all the beasts of the field / Bore their young under its branches, / And in its shade / All great nations dwelt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Thus it was beautiful in its greatness, / In the length of its branches; / For its roots were beside abundant waters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; / Cypresses could not compare to its boughs, / And plane trees could not equal its branches; / No tree in the garden of God could compare to it in its beauty.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I made it beautiful / By the multitude of its branches, / So that all the trees of Eden, / Which were in the garden of God, envied it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you are exalted in height — it set its top shoots among the thick boughs, and its heart is lifted up in its height —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Therefore I will deliver it into the hands of the mighty one of the nations; he will surely deal with it. I have driven it out according to its wickedness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And strangers, the most ruthless of the nations, have cut it down and left it on the mountains, and its branches have fallen into all the valleys, and its boughs <i>lie</i> broken by all the ravines of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have abandoned its shade and left it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Upon its fallen trunk / All the birds of the sky will dwell, / And upon its branches / All the beasts of the field will be.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> <i>This is</i> so that none of the <i>well-watered</i> trees will exalt themselves in their height by setting their top shoots among the thick boughs, and none of the well-watered trees <i>will</i> stand next to them in their height; for all of them have been delivered to death, to the lowest parts of the earth among the children of men who descend into the pit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, On the day it descended to Sheol I caused a mourning; I covered the deep <i>springs</i> for it, and I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were shut up. I also made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted on account of it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I cast it down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit. And all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all who drink water, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> They also descended with it into Sheol to those who were slain by the sword; indeed to those who were its arm, <i>who</i> dwelt under its shade among the nations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Which among the trees of Eden then are you like in glory and in greatness? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lowest parts of the earth; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and say to him,You likened yourself to a lion of the nations, / Yet you are like a monster in the seas; / And you gushed forth with your rivers / And muddied the waters with your feet / And fouled their rivers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah,I will spread My net upon you / With a company of many peoples, / And they will bring you up in My dragnet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I will abandon you upon the land; / I will cast you out into the open field, / And I will cause all the birds of the sky to settle upon you / And satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And I will lay your flesh upon the mountains / And fill the valleys with your corpse.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> I will also drench the land with your outpoured blood / As far as the mountains, / And the ravines will be full of you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And when I extinguish you, / I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; / I will cover the sun with a cloud, / And the moon will not give its light.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> All the bright lights of heaven / I will darken over you / And send darkness upon your land, / Declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I will also bring anguish to the hearts of many peoples, when I bring <i>news of</i> your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Yes, I will astonish many peoples because of you, and their kings will shudder excessively over you, when I brandish My sword before them; they will also tremble continually, everyone for his own life, on the day of your fall.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, The king of Babylon’s sword will come upon you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> By the swords of the mighty, / All of them the ruthless of the nations, / I will cause your multitude to fall; / And they will devastate the pride of Egypt, / And all its multitude will be destroyed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I will also destroy all its beasts / From beside abundant waters; / No longer will human feet muddy them, / Nor will the hooves of beasts muddy them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Then I will make their waters clear / And their rivers flow like oil, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> When I make the land of Egypt desolate, / A land destitute of what filled it, / When I strike all its inhabitants, / They will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> This is the lamentation with which they will lament. The daughters of the nations will lament with it; over Egypt and over all her multitude they will lament with it, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth <i>day</i> of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, her and the daughters of mighty nations, to the lowest parts of the earth, with those who descend to the pit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> They will fall in the midst of those slain by the sword; she is delivered to the sword. Drag her away with all her multitudes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> The strong among the mighty will speak to him and his allies from the midst of Sheol; they have gone down; they lie still, the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Assyria and all her company are there with their graves all around her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is all around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who had struck terror in the land of the living.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Elam and all her multitude are there, all around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have descended uncircumcised into the lowest parts of the earth, who had struck their terror in the land of the living and bore their disgrace with those who descend to the pit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> They have made her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; their graves are all around her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword. Although their terror was struck in the land of the living, they <i>now</i> bear their disgrace with those who descend to the pit. They are placed among the slain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude are there; their graves are all around them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword. Although they had struck their terror in the land of the living,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> They will not lie with the mighty uncircumcised who fell, who descended to Sheol with their weapons of war and laid their swords under their heads and their iniquities upon their bones, even though <i>they were</i> the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> But you will be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and lie with those slain by the sword.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Edom is there, her kings and all her princes, who in their might are placed with those slain by the sword; they will lie with the uncircumcised and with those who descend to the pit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> The princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians are there, who descended with the slain; they are put to shame in spite of the terror they struck by their might. They also lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bear their shame with those who descend to the pit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Pharaoh will see them and be comforted over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> For I have put his terror in the land of the living, and he will be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

			<h4 id="ezekiel-33">Ezekiel 33</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them, Whenever I bring the sword upon a land and the people of the land take a man from their midst and set him up as their watchman,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blows the trumpet and warns the people;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and ignores the warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> He heard the sound of the trumpet and ignored the warning; his own blood will be on him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But if the watchman sees the sword come and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned and the sword comes and takes someone away from them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> It is you, O son of man, whom I have appointed as a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore when you hear the word from My mouth, give them warning from Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> When I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you will surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man will die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Yet if you warn the wicked man of his way to turn from it and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, and you have delivered your soul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, This is what you speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and because of them we are wasting away. How then can we live?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn away from his way and live. Turn away, turn away from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And you, son of man, say to the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him on the day of his transgression, and the wickedness of the wicked will not stumble him on the day he turns away from his wickedness. The righteous cannot be kept alive just because of <i>his</i> righteousness on the day he sins.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> When I say concerning the righteous man, He will surely live, but if he has confidence in his righteousness and practices iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered. As for his iniquity that he practiced, in it he will die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Again, when I say to the wicked man, You will surely die, but if he turns away from his sin and practices justice and righteousness —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> <i>If</i> the wicked man restores a pledge, makes restitution for what he took in robbery, walks in the statutes of life, practicing no iniquity — he will surely live; he will not die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him; he has practiced justice and righteousness; he will surely live.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not fair; but as for them, their way is not fair.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> When a righteous man turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, he will even die in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And when a wicked man turns from his wickedness and practices justice and righteousness, he will live by them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, I will judge every one of you according to his ways.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth <i>month,</i> on the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city has been struck down.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Now the hand of Jehovah had come upon me in the evening, before the coming of the one who had escaped; and He had opened my mouth before he came to me in the morning. Therefore my mouth was opened, and I was no longer dumb.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Son of man, the inhabitants of those ruined places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one person, and he was given the land as an inheritance; but we are many; <i>surely</i> the land has been given to us for an inheritance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, You eat <i>meat</i> with the blood and lift up your eyes to your idols and shed blood. Will you indeed possess the land?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> You depend on your sword; you have committed abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Will you indeed possess the land?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Thus will you say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, As I live, surely those who are in the ruined places will fall by the sword, and he who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of pestilence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of her strength will cease, and the mountains of Israel will be desolate without anyone passing through.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Then will they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste, because of all their abominations which they have committed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And as for you, son of man, the children of your people talk about you by the walls and in the entrances of the houses and speak to one another, each to his brother, saying, Come now, and hear what is the word that comes forth from Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And they come to you just as people come, and they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words but do not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And indeed you are to them like a very lovely song of one with a pleasant voice, who can play an instrument well; for they hear your words but do not do them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And when this comes about — indeed it comes — then they will know that a prophet has been among them.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the sheep?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> You eat the fat, and you clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings, but you do not feed the sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> The weak you have not strengthened, and the sick one you have not healed, and the broken one you have not bound up, and the one that was driven away you have not brought back, and the lost one you have not sought; but with strength and rigor you have ruled over them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they were scattered without a shepherd, and they became food to all the beasts of the field and were scattered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> My sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill. Indeed My sheep were scattered over all the surface of the earth; not even one searched for or sought after <i>them.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely inasmuch as My sheep became prey, and My sheep became food to all the beasts of the field because there was no shepherd, nor did My shepherds search for My sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My sheep;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Indeed I am against the shepherds, and I will require My sheep at their hand and stop them from feeding the sheep, and the shepherds will no longer feed themselves; but I will deliver My sheep from their mouth so that they may not be food for them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, I Myself, even I, will search for My sheep and seek them out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day when he is among his sheep which are scattered, so I will seek out My sheep; and I will deliver them from all the places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them into their own land, and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the streams and in all the inhabited places of the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> I will feed them with good pasture, and their dwelling place will be upon the mountains of the heights of Israel; there they will lie down in a good dwelling place, and on rich pasture they will feed upon the mountains of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> I Myself will shepherd My flock, and I will cause them to lie down, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> I will seek the lost one and bring back the one that was driven away and bind up the broken one and strengthen the sick one; but the fat one and the strong one I will destroy — I will feed them with judgment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And as for you, O My flock, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will judge between one sheep and another, <i>between</i> the rams and the male goats.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture and trample down the rest of your pasture with your feet and drink the clear water and foul the rest with your feet?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Meanwhile My flock must feed on what is trampled by your feet and drink what is fouled by your feet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah to them, It is I who am about to judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted all the weak with your horns until you scattered them abroad,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> I will rescue My flock, and they will no longer be prey; and I will judge between one sheep and another.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And I will set up over them one Shepherd, My Servant David, and He will feed them; He will feed them, and He will be their Shepherd.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and My Servant David will be a Prince among them. I, Jehovah, have spoken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish evil beasts from the land, so that they will dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing, and I will cause the showers to come down in their season; there will be showers of blessing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the trees of the field will yield their fruit, and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure in their land; then they will know that I am Jehovah, when I break the bars of their yoke and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And they will no longer be prey to the nations, nor will the beasts of the earth devour them; but they will dwell securely, and no one will make <i>them</i> afraid.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And I will raise up for them a planting place of renown, and they will no longer be consumed with famine in the land and no longer bear the disgrace of the nations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Thus they will know that I, Jehovah their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And you are My flock, the flock of My pasture; you are men, and I am your God, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> I will lay your cities waste, / And you will be desolate; / And you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Because you have had a perpetual enmity and handed the children of Israel over to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, in the time of the punishment of the end;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare you for blood, and blood will pursue you; since you have not hated bloodshed, therefore bloodshed will pursue you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Thus I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation, and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I will fill its mountains with its slain. Those slain by the sword will fall in your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited, and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries will belong to me, and we will possess them — even though Jehovah was there —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will deal <i>with you</i> according to your anger and according to your jealousy, which you displayed in your hatred of them, and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And you will know that I, Jehovah, have heard all your reviling which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are desolate; they have been given to us to devour.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And you have magnified yourselves against Me with your mouth and multiplied your words against Me; I have heard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be desolate, O Mount Seir and all Edom, the whole land. Then they will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because the enemy has said against you, Aha! Even the ancient high places have become our possession!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Therefore prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because, even because, they have desolated and crushed you from every side so that you might become the possession of the remnant of the nations, and you have been taken up in the talk of <i>different</i> tongues and in the whispering of people;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah. Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys, to the desolate ruins and to the forsaken cities, which have become plunder and a mocking to the remnant of the nations which are all around;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Surely in the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the remnant of the nations and against Edom, all of whom have appointed My land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despising in <i>their</i> soul, for their pasture <i>and</i> plunder.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I will multiply people upon you, the entire house of Israel, all of it! The cities will also be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> I will also multiply upon you man and beast, and they will increase and be fruitful, and I will make you inhabited as you were formerly, and I will make it better <i>for you</i> than when you began. Then you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Therefore you will no longer devour men or any longer bereave your nation of children, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And I will no longer let you hear the disgrace of the nations nor any longer bear the reproach of the peoples, and you will no longer cause your nation to stumble, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings; their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Therefore I poured out My wrath upon them because of the blood which they had poured out upon the land and because they had defiled it with their idols.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. According to their way and according to their doings I judged them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And when they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, inasmuch as it was said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and they have gone forth out of His land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> But I had regard for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am not doing <i>this</i> for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations will know that I am Jehovah, declares the Lord Jehovah, when I am sanctified in you in their sight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your filthiness and from all your idols I will cleanse you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and My ordinances you shall keep and do.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers; and you will be My people, and I will be your God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And I will save you from all your uncleanness, and I will summon the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the produce of the field, that you may no longer receive the reproach of famine among the nations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Then you will remember your evil ways and your doings that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> It is not for your sake that I am doing <i>this,</i> declares the Lord Jehovah; let it be known to you. Be ashamed and humiliated on account of your ways, O house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And the land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being desolate in the sight of all who passed by.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And they will say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified <i>and</i> inhabited.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Then the nations that are left all around you will know that I, Jehovah, have rebuilt the ruined places <i>and</i> planted that which was desolate. I, Jehovah, have spoken, and I will do <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Moreover for this I will be inquired of by the house of Israel to do <i>it</i> for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> Like the holy flock <i>for sacrifices,</i> like the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The hand of Jehovah came upon me, and He brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And He caused me to pass all around among them, and there were very many on the surface of the valley, and they were also very dry.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, You know.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then He said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah to these bones: I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I will put sinews on you and bring flesh back on you and cover you with skin and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you will know that I am Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh came back, and skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then He said to me, Prophesy to the wind; prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them; and they lived and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then He said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Now they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Now I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, O My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And you will know that I am Jehovah, when I open your graves and bring you up out of your graves, O My people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live; and I will place you in your own land. Then you will know that I, Jehovah, have spoken and that I have performed <i>it,</i> declares Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you, son of man, take one piece of wood, and write upon it, For Judah and for the children of Israel associated with him; then take another piece of wood, and write upon it, For Joseph, the piece of wood of Ephraim, and <i>for</i> all the house of Israel associated with him;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And bring them together, one <i>side</i> to the other, into one piece of wood, that they may become united in your hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, Will you not tell us what you mean by these?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am about to take the piece of wood of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel associated with him; and I will put them upon it, that is, the piece of wood of Judah, and make them one piece of wood, and they will be one in My hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the pieces of wood on which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am about to take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they have gone, and I will gather them from all around and bring them into their own land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel, and one king will be king to all of them; and they will no longer be two nations, nor will they be divided into two kingdoms anymore at all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> They will not defile themselves any longer with their idols, or their detestable things, or any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them. Therefore they will be My people, and I will be their God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And My Servant David will be King over them, and they all will have one Shepherd. They will also walk in My ordinances and observe My statutes and do them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And they will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers dwelt; and they will dwell in it, they, their children, and their children’s children, forever. And David My Servant will be their Prince forever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> I will also make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them <i>there</i> and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forever,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And My tabernacle will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Indeed I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And you will go up, coming like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes and many peoples with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, On that day things will come up in your heart, and you will devise an evil device.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And you will say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will come upon those at rest, dwelling securely, all of them dwelling without walls, without bars or doors;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish, with all their young lions, will say to you, Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your company to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to seize great spoil?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Surely on that day when My people Israel are dwelling securely, you will recognize <i>it;</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And you will come from your place from the remotest parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And you will come up against My people Israel, like a cloud to cover the land. In the last days I will bring you against My land so that the nations may know Me, when I am sanctified through you, O Gog, before their eyes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Are you the one of whom I spoke in earlier times through My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for <i>many</i> years that I would bring you against them?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah, My wrath will come up in My nostrils.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the beasts of the field, all the creeping things that creep upon the earth, and every human being on the surface of the earth will quake at My presence, and mountains will be thrown down, and slopes will slide, and every wall will fall to the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And I will call to all My mountains for a sword against him, declares the Lord Jehovah; every man’s sword shall be against his brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain torrential rain and great hailstones, fire and brimstone, upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And they shall bear their disgrace and all their trespasses with which they have trespassed against Me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and no one will make them afraid.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, I will be sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that same day the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and He brought me there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me down upon a very high mountain, and on it to the south there was a structure like a city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He brought me there, and there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring reed in His hand, standing in the gate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the man said to me, Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I show you, because for this purpose you have been brought here, that it may be shown to you. Tell all that you see to the house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Now there was a wall all around the outside of the house, and in the man’s hand <i>there was</i> a measuring reed six cubits long, each <i>cubit being</i> a cubit and a handbreadth. So He measured the thickness of the structure, one reed; and the height, one reed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then He came to the gate which faces toward the east and went up its steps, and He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep; and each threshold was one reed deep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And every guardroom was one reed long and one reed wide, and <i>the space</i> between the guardrooms was five cubits, and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then He measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And there were three guardrooms on one side and three on the other side of the gate, which was facing east; and the three of them had the same measurement, and the posts had the same measurement on both sides.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And He measured the width of the entrance of the gate, ten cubits; and the <i>total</i> length of the gate was thirteen cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And there was a border before the guardrooms, one cubit <i>on this side,</i> and a border, one cubit on that side; and the guardrooms were six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And He measured the <i>total</i> gate width from the roof <i>edge</i> of one guardroom to the roof <i>edge</i> of the other, twenty-five cubits. The entrances <i>of the guardrooms</i> were opposite each other.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> He also made <i>a measurement</i> of the posts, sixty cubits <i>in all;</i> and the gate surrounded a court <i>which reached</i> to the posts.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And <i>the distance from</i> the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner porch of the gate was fifty cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the guardrooms and their posts had latticed windows within <i>and</i> all around the gate. The porches also had windows within <i>and</i> all around, and palm trees were on <i>each</i> post.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Then He brought me into the outer court, and there were chambers and a pavement made for the court all around; thirty chambers were upon the pavement.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the pavement flanked the gates, <i>its width</i> equal to the length of the gates; <i>that is,</i> the lower pavement.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Then He measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the front of the outside of the inner court <i>gate,</i> a hundred cubits, <i>both</i> on the east and on the north.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then He measured the gate of the outer court which faced toward the north, its length and its width.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And it had three guardrooms on this side and three on that side. And its posts and its porch were of the same measurement as the first gate; its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And its windows and its porch and its palm trees were of the same measurement as the gate which faced toward the east, and seven steps led up to it, and its porch was in front of them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And there was a gate to the inner court opposite the <i>outer</i> gate, <i>both</i> on the north and on the east. And He measured <i>the distance</i> from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And He led me toward the south, and there was a gate toward the south, and He measured its posts and its porch according to those same measurements.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And the gate and its porch had windows all around just like those other windows; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And there were seven steps going up to it, and its porch was in front of them; and it had palm trees upon its posts, one on each side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south, and He measured <i>the distance</i> from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Then He brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and He measured the south gate according to those same measurements,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And its guardrooms and its posts and its porches according to those same measurements; and it had windows in and around <i>it</i> and its porches; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And there were porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And its porches were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon its posts, and its steps had eight steps.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And He brought me into the inner court toward the east, and He measured the gate according to those same measurements,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And its guardrooms and its posts and its porches according to those same measurements; and it had windows in and around <i>it</i> and its porches; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And its porches were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon its posts on each side, and its steps had eight steps.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And He brought me to the north gate, and He measured <i>it</i> according to those same measurements,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Its guardrooms, its posts, and its porches; and it had windows in and around <i>it;</i> the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And its porches were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon its posts, on each side, and its steps had eight steps.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And a chamber with its entrance was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt offering.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side on which to slay the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And on <i>one</i> side outside, as one goes up to the entrance of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side beside the gate; eight tables on which they slaughtered <i>the sacrifices.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And there were four tables for the burnt offering, <i>made</i> of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long and a cubit and a half wide and one cubit high, on which they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> And double hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened on the inside all around. And upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And outside the inner gate in the inner court were two chambers, <i>one</i> at the side of the north gate facing toward the south; one at the side of the south gate facing toward the north.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> And He said to me, This chamber that faces toward the south is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And the chamber that faces toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who come near to Jehovah to minister to Him from among the sons of Levi.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And He measured the court, a square, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide; and the altar was in front of the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> Then He brought me to the porch of the house and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gate was fourteen cubits, plus the side indents in the gate, three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width twelve cubits, and ten steps led up to it; and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then He went into the inner <i>temple</i> and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width <i>on either side of</i> the entrance, seven cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And He measured the length <i>of the inner temple,</i> twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the <i>outer</i> temple; and He said to me, This is the Holy of Holies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then He measured the wall of the house, six cubits <i>thick;</i> and the width of every side chamber, four cubits, all around the house on every side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, with thirty units <i>in each story;</i> and they extended to the wall, which the house had for the side chambers all around to be supports, so that there would not be supports <i>inserted</i> into the wall of the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the side chambers that went around <i>the house</i> became wider as they went up by stories. Because the surrounding of the house increased upward around the house, therefore the house had width upward; and so one went up <i>from</i> the lowest <i>story</i> to the highest through the middle <i>story.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I also saw that the house had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six long cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits; and space that was left <i>alongside</i> the side chambers belonged to the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And between the chambers <i>and the house</i> was a width of twenty cubits all around the house on every side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the entrances of the side chambers were toward <i>the space</i> that was left, one entrance toward the north and another entrance toward the south; and the width of the place that was left was five cubits all around.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the building that was in front of the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> So He measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place <i>at the back</i> and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the width of the front of the house and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He measured the length of the building before the separate place, which was behind it, and its galleries on one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits. And the <i>outer</i> temple, the inner <i>temple,</i> the porches of the court,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> The thresholds, the latticed windows, and the galleries of the surrounding <i>side chambers</i> with their three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, even <i>from</i> the ground to the windows (now the windows were latticed),<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> To the top of the entrance, both in the inner house and outside. And on all the walls all around inside and outside, by measurement,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Were both carved cherubim and palm trees. And a palm tree was between two cherubim, and every cherub had two faces.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> So there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other side. So it was carved in and around the whole house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> From the ground to the top of the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved, even <i>on</i> the wall of the temple.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> The temple doorposts were squared. And <i>at</i> the front of the sanctuary was something in appearance like the appearance of<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> A wooden altar, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, its length, and its walls were <i>made of</i> wood. And He said to me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Now the temple and the sanctuary had double doors.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the double doors had two swinging leaves, two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And carved on these, on the doors of the temple, were cherubim and palm trees, just like those carved on the walls. And there was a threshold of wood upon the front of the porch outside.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And there were latticed windows and palm trees on either side, on the sides of the porch, the side chambers of the house, and the thresholds.<br><br>

			<h4 id="ezekiel-42">Ezekiel 42</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then He brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north, and He brought me into the chamber that was adjacent to the separate place and which was adjacent to the building toward the north.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> The length of the side of the northern entrance was a hundred cubits, and the width was fifty cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Adjacent to the twenty-<i>cubit space</i> of the inner court and adjacent to the pavement of the outer court was gallery facing gallery on the third <i>story.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And before the chambers on the inside was a walkway of ten cubits’ width, a way of one <i>hundred</i> cubits; and their entrances were toward the north.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more <i>space</i> away from these than from the lower and the middle <i>stories</i> in the building.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For they were arranged in three <i>stories,</i> and they did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore <i>the upper story</i> was set back from the ground more than the lower and middle <i>stories.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> There was also an outside wall beside the chambers, toward the outer court in front of the chambers; its length was fifty cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits, while those facing the temple were a hundred cubits.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And at the foot of these chambers was an entrance on the east side to enter them from the outer court;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> By the breadth of the wall of the court to the south, beside the separate place and beside the building, there were chambers,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> With a way before them. <i>Their appearance</i> was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north; just as their length, so <i>also was</i> their width; and all their exits were according to both their arrangements and their entrances.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> So the entrances of the chambers that were toward the south were entered <i>through</i> an entrance toward the east at the head of the corresponding way, directly beside the wall.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then He said to me, The north chambers and the south chambers which are beside the separate place are holy chambers, where the priests who are near to Jehovah shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering, for the place is holy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> When the priests enter, they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they have ministered, because they are holy. And they shall put on other garments and approach the area <i>designated</i> for the people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Now when He had finished measuring the inner house, He brought me out through the gate which faces toward the east and measured it all around.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> He turned to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> He measured it on four sides. It had a wall all around, the length five hundred <i>reeds</i> and the width five hundred <i>reeds,</i> to make a separation between what was holy and what was common.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then He brought me to the gate, that is, the gate that faces toward the east.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the glory of the God of Israel was there, coming from the way of the east, and His voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth was illuminated with His glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, that is, like the vision that I had seen when He came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I had seen by the river Chebar. And I fell on my face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the glory of Jehovah came into the house through the gate which faced toward the east.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court, and just then the glory of Jehovah filled the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And I heard someone speaking to me out of the house, and a man stood beside me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, <i>this is</i> the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. And the house of Israel will no longer defile My holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their fornication and by their kings’ dead bodies <i>on</i> their high places.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> When they placed their threshold by My threshold and their doorpost beside My doorpost, there was <i>only</i> the wall between Me and them, and they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them in My anger.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Now let them put away their fornication and the dead bodies of their kings far from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> You, O son of man, describe the house to the house of Israel, that they may feel humiliated because of their iniquities, and let them measure the pattern.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And if they feel humiliated because of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house, its arrangement, its exits, its entrances, its whole design, and all its statutes — indeed its whole design and all its laws; and write <i>them</i> down in their sight, that they may keep its whole design and all its statutes, and do them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> This is the law of the house: Its entire area on the top of <i>and</i> all around the mountain shall be most holy. Indeed this is the law of the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Now these are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth). The bottom shall be a cubit <i>in height,</i> a cubit in depth, and its surrounding border on its edge, a span. Now this is the base of the altar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And from <i>the top of</i> the bottom upon the ground to <i>the top of</i> the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and one cubit in depth; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and a cubit in depth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the altar hearth shall be four cubits <i>in height;</i> and from the altar hearth there shall also be four horns <i>projecting</i> upward.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the altar hearth shall be twelve <i>cubits</i> long by twelve <i>cubits</i> wide, square on its four sides.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the <i>greater</i> ledge shall be fourteen <i>cubits</i> long by fourteen <i>cubits</i> wide on its four sides, and its surrounding border shall be half a cubit, and its bottom shall be a cubit all around, and its steps shall face east.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, These are the statutes of the altar <i>to be observed</i> on the day when they make it, for offering up burnt offerings on it and for sprinkling blood upon it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> You shall give the Levitical priests who are of the seed of Zadok, who draw near to Me to minister to Me, declares the Lord Jehovah, a bull of the herd for a sin offering.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And you shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the surrounding border. Thus you shall purify it and make expiation for it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And on the second day you shall present a male goat without blemish for a sin offering, and they shall purify the altar, just as they purified <i>it</i> with the bull.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> When you have finished purifying <i>it,</i> you shall present a bull of the herd without blemish and a ram of the flock without blemish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And you shall present them before Jehovah, and the priests shall throw salt upon them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Each day for seven days you shall offer a goat for a sin offering; they shall also offer a bull of the herd and a ram out of the flock without blemish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Seven days they shall make expiation for the altar and cleanse it, and so consecrate it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And when they have fulfilled the days, on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings upon the altar; and I will accept you, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east, but it was shut.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> As for the Prince, He will sit in it as a prince to eat food before Jehovah; He will enter through the porch of the gate and go out the same way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then He brought me through the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and just then the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah, and I fell upon my face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, pay attention, and look with your eyes, and listen with your ears to all that I say to you concerning all the statutes of the house of Jehovah and all its laws; and pay attention to the entrance of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you shall say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Enough, O house of Israel, of all your abominations,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And you have not kept the charge of My holy things, but you have set your own keepers of My charge in My sanctuary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, of any of the foreigners who are among the children of Israel shall enter into My sanctuary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from Me after their idols, shall bear their iniquity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Yet they shall minister in My sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house. They shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn concerning them, declares the Lord Jehovah, that they shall bear their iniquity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And they shall not come near to Me to serve Me as a priest, nor come near to any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their disgrace and their abominations which they have committed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Yet I will appoint them keepers of the charge of the house, for all its service and for all that will be done in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to present to Me the fat and the blood, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> It is they who will enter My sanctuary, and it is they who will come near to My table to minister to Me, and they will keep My charge.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And when they enter the gates of the inner court they shall be clothed with linen garments, and no wool will come upon them while they minister in the gates of the inner court and inside <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> They shall have linen turbans on their heads and have linen trousers over their loins; they shall not gird themselves with <i>anything that causes</i> sweat.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And when they go out into the outer court, into the outer court to the people, they shall take off their garments with which they minister and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments so that they do not sanctify the people with their garments.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> They shall neither shave their heads, nor let their locks grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And none of the priests shall drink wine when they enter the inner court.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And they shall not take as their wives a widow or a divorced woman, but rather they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel or a widow who is the widow of a priest.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the profane and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And in a dispute they shall stand as a judge; according to My ordinances they shall give judgment concerning it. They shall also keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed feasts, and they shall sanctify My Sabbaths.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And they shall not go to any dead person to defile themselves. Only for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, or a sister who has had no husband may they defile themselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And after he has been cleansed, they shall number seven days for him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And on the day he enters the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he shall present his sin offering, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance. And you shall not give them a possession in Israel — I am their possession.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> They shall eat the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And the first of all the firstfruits of everything, and every heave offering of everything, of all your heave offerings, shall be the priests’. You shall also give the priests the first of your dough to cause a blessing to rest on your house.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Moreover when you divide the land for inheritance by lot, you shall offer a heave offering <i>of land</i> to Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; <i>its</i> length shall be twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i> long, and <i>its</i> width twenty thousand <i>reeds;</i> it shall be holy within all its surrounding border.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> From this there will be <i>reserved</i> for the holy place a five hundred <i>reed</i> by five hundred <i>reed</i> square all around, and fifty cubits for its surrounding suburbs.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> You shall also measure from this measurement a length of twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i> and a width of ten thousand <i>reeds,</i> and in it will be the sanctuary, the most holy place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to Jehovah, and it shall be a place for their houses as well as a holy area for the sanctuary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And <i>an area</i> twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i> in length and ten thousand <i>reeds</i> in width shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, for their own possession, <i>for</i> cities to live in.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> This is the heave offering which you shall offer: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> In the first <i>month,</i> on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And on that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the prince shall come in among them when they enter, and when they go out, they shall go out <i>together.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And at the feasts and at the appointed feasts the meal offering shall be an ephah for a bull and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil for an ephah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And when the prince prepares a freewill offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to Jehovah, someone will open for him the gate that faces east; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he does on the Sabbath day.

				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And you shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to Jehovah daily, every morning you shall provide it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And you shall provide with it a meal offering every morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. It is a meal offering to Jehovah continually, a perpetual statute.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Thus they shall provide the lamb and the meal offering and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance. It shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And He said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, <i>and</i> where they shall bake the meal offering, so that they do not bring <i>them</i> out into the outer court, thereby sanctifying the people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then He brought me out into the outer court and led me past the four corners of the court; and there in each corner of the court was a court.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> In the four corners of the court there were enclosed courts, forty <i>cubits</i> long and thirty <i>cubits</i> wide. These four <i>enclosed courts</i> in the corners were of one measurement.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And there was a wall all around them, around all four, and boiling places were made at the base of the walls all around.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then He said to me, These are the boiling houses, where those who minister in the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.<br><br>

			<h4 id="ezekiel-47">Ezekiel 47</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then He brought me back to the entrance of the house, and there was water flowing out from under the threshold of the house to the east (for the house faced east); and the water flowed down below the south side of the house, on the south of the altar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Then He brought me out by the way of the north gate and led me around on the way outside to the outer gate, on the way to <i>the gate</i> that faces east; and there the water was running out on the south side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> When the man went out to the east with the line in His hand, He measured a thousand cubits; and He led me through the water, water that was to the ankles.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then He measured a thousand <i>cubits</i> and led me through the water, water that was to the knees. Then He measured a thousand <i>cubits</i> and led me through <i>the water,</i> water that was to the loins.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then He measured a thousand <i>cubits, and it was</i> a river that I could not pass through; for the water had risen, <i>enough</i> water to swim in, a river that could not be crossed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And He said to me, Son of man, have you seen <i>this?</i> Then He led me and brought me back along the bank of the river.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And when I returned, there were very many trees on the bank of the river, on one side and on the other.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then said He to me, This water flows out toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah and goes to the sea; when it flows into the sea, the water <i>of the sea</i> is healed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes shall live, and there will be very many fish when this water comes there. And <i>the water of the sea</i> shall be healed, and everything shall live wherever the river comes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And fishermen will stand beside the sea from En-gedi even to En-eglaim; it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish shall be according to their kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> But its swamps and its marshes will not be healed; they shall be left for salt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And on the banks on both sides of the river will grow all <i>kinds</i> of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail; but they will bring forth new fruit every month, because the water for them flows out of the sanctuary. And their fruit shall be for food, and their leaves for healing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, This is the boundary by which you shall divide up the land as an inheritance for the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall have two portions.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And you shall divide it for an inheritance, each one equally with the other, for I swore to give it to your fathers, and this land will fall to you as an inheritance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> This shall be the border of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Hamath, <i>and on</i> to Zedad;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the territory of Damascus and the territory of Hamath), <i>to</i> Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Thus the border shall extend from the sea <i>to</i> Hazar-enan <i>on</i> the border of <i>the territory of</i> Damascus, and on the north toward the north is the territory of Hamath. This is the north side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And on the east side, from between Hauran and Damascus, and from between Gilead and the land of Israel, <i>that is,</i> the Jordan, you shall measure from the <i>north</i> border to the eastern sea. This is the east side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the south side toward the south, <i>the border shall go</i> from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah-kadesh, to the brook <i>of Egypt, and</i> to the Great Sea. This is the south side toward the south.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the west side <i>shall be</i> the Great Sea, from the <i>south</i> border to opposite the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> So you shall apportion this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves and among the sojourners who sojourn among you, who bring forth sons among you. And they shall be to you just like the native among the sons of Israel; they shall be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And in whatever tribe the sojourner sojourns, you shall give <i>him</i> his inheritance there, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, along the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, <i>and</i> Hazar-enan on the border of <i>the territory of</i> Damascus with Hamath to the north (with their sides extending <i>from</i> east <i>to</i> west), Dan, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And alongside the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And alongside the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side, Naphtali, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And alongside the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, Manasseh, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And alongside the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, Ephraim, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And alongside the border of Ephraim, from the east side even to the west side, Reuben, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And alongside the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And alongside the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the heave offering <i>of land</i> which you shall offer, twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i> in width, and in length just like one of the portions <i>of the tribes</i> from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in its midst.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> The heave offering that you shall offer to Jehovah shall be twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i> in length and ten thousand <i>reeds</i> in width.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And for these, that is, for the priests, shall be the holy heave offering — on the north twenty-five thousand <i>reeds in length,</i> on the west ten thousand <i>reeds</i> in width, on the east ten thousand <i>reeds</i> in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i> in length; and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in its midst.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> <i>This is</i> for the priests who are sanctified from among the sons of Zadok, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And it shall be theirs as a heave offering from the heave offering of the land, most holy, alongside the territory of the Levites.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites <i>shall have a portion</i> twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i> in length and ten thousand <i>reeds</i> in width. The whole length shall be twenty-five thousand <i>reeds,</i> and <i>its</i> width ten thousand <i>reeds.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And they shall not sell or exchange or transfer any of it; <i>it is</i> the firstfruits of the land, for it is holy to Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the five thousand <i>reeds</i> remaining of the width, alongside the twenty-five thousand <i>reeds,</i> shall be for common use: for the city, for dwellings, and for suburbs; and the city shall be in its midst.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And these shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred <i>reeds,</i> the south side four thousand five hundred <i>reeds,</i> on the east side four thousand five hundred <i>reeds,</i> and the west side four thousand five hundred <i>reeds.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the city shall have suburbs: two hundred fifty <i>reeds</i> to the north, two hundred fifty <i>reeds</i> to the south, two hundred fifty <i>reeds</i> to the east, and two hundred fifty <i>reeds</i> to the west.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the remaining length, alongside the holy heave offering, shall be ten thousand <i>reeds</i> to the east and ten thousand <i>reeds</i> to the west, and it shall be alongside the holy heave offering. And its produce shall be food for those who labor in the city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And those who labor in the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall work it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The entire heave offering <i>of land</i> shall be twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i> by twenty-five thousand <i>reeds.</i> You shall offer the holy heave offering, a square, including the possession of the city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And what is remaining on both sides of the holy heave offering and of the city’s possession shall be for the prince; adjacent to the twenty-five thousand <i>reeds of the heave offering</i> unto the eastern border, and to the west adjacent to the twenty-five thousand reeds of the heave offering to the western border, alongside the portions <i>of the tribes,</i> it shall be for the prince. And the holy heave offering and the sanctuary of the house shall be in its midst.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And it shall be <i>distinct</i> from the possession of the Levites and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of what belongs to the prince. <i>The remaining area</i> lying between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin shall be for the prince.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And alongside the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And alongside the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And alongside the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And alongside the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad, one <i>portion.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And alongside the border of Gad, at the south side to the south, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah-kadesh to the brook <i>of Egypt</i> to the Great Sea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for an inheritance, and these are their portions, declares the Lord Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And these are the exits of the city: On the north side, <i>which</i> measures four thousand five hundred <i>reeds,</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> (Now the gates of the city shall be according to the names of the tribes of Israel) three gates to the north: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And on the east side, <i>which is</i> four thousand five hundred <i>reeds,</i> another three gates: the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And on the south side, <i>which</i> measures four thousand five hundred <i>reeds,</i> another three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> On the west side, <i>which is</i> four thousand five hundred <i>reeds,</i> their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> It shall be eighteen thousand <i>reeds</i> all around, and the name of the city from that day shall be, Jehovah Is There.<br><br>
